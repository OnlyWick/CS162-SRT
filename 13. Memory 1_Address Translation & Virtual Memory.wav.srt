00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello, everyone.
大家好。

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,040
So today, during today's lecture, we are going to finish the discussion on the deadlocks
所以今天，在今天的讲座中，我们将完成对死锁的讨论。

3
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:32,700
and then continue to learn about virtual memory and address translation.
然后继续学习虚拟内存和地址转换。

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,880
So last time, we spent quite a bit on deadlocks.
上次，我们花了相当多的时间讨论死锁问题。

5
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,400
Deadlocks is a very important concept.
死锁是一个非常重要的概念。

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:48,360
And if you remember, there are four requirements which needs to happen to have a deadlock.
如果你还记得的话，有四个条件需要满足才能发生死锁。

7
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,040
The first is mutual exclusion.
第一个是互斥。

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,660
That means that only one thread at a time can use a particular resource.
这意味着一次只有一个线程可以使用特定的资源。

9
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,240
The second is hold and wait.
第二个是持有和等待。

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:05,480
That is a thread holding holds at least one resource and is waiting to acquire additional
这是一个持有至少一个资源并正在等待获取更多资源的线程。

11
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,060
resources which are held by other threads.
其他线程所持有的资源。

12
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,280
So this means that the thread cannot make progress because it needs the other resources
所以这意味着线程无法取得进展，因为它需要其他资源。

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:21,080
in order to make to finish the computation, which again are owned by other threads.
为了完成计算，这些计算又被其他线程所拥有。

14
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,040
No preemptions.
不要中断。

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,160
Resources are released only voluntarily by a thread holding the resource.
资源只有在持有资源的线程自愿释放时才会被释放。

16
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,120
So a thread cannot preempt another thread to get the resource to finish the computation.
所以一个线程不能抢占另一个线程的资源来完成计算。

17
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,760
And then in circular wait, so you have a cycle, which is a cycle which is defined by the pattern
然后在循环等待中，所以你有一个循环，这个循环由模式定义。

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:48,640
that a thread is waiting for a resource that is held by another thread.
有一个线程正在等待另一个线程持有的资源。

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,000
And that thread is waiting for a resource that is held by another thread and so on until
而那个线程正在等待另一个线程持有的资源，以此类推，直到...

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,720
you get a cycle.
你得到了一个循环。

21
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:10,760
Also last, there are several techniques we listed last time to resolve a deadlock.
还有最后一点，我们上次列出了几种解决死锁的技术。

22
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:16,760
And one of them is to recover from the deadlock.
其中之一是从僵局中恢复过来。

23
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,120
And some of the things we mentioned last time was to terminate the thread.
上次我们提到的一些事情是终止线程。

24
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,680
So therefore, you can terminate a thread which owns the resource so other threads can acquire
所以，你可以终止拥有资源的线程，以便其他线程可以获取。

25
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,420
the resource and can finish their computation.
资源并且能够完成他们的计算。

26
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,200
Of course, you don't always want to do that.
当然，你并不总是想这样做。

27
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,820
In some cases, it's pretty hard.
有些情况下，这是相当困难的。

28
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:48,560
Like for instance, you can kill a thread which is modifying some sensitive data or important
例如，你可以终止一个正在修改敏感数据或重要数据的线程。

29
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
data.
数据。

30
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:57,080
Then you can, like for instance, updating your bank balance.
那么你可以，比如说，更新你的银行余额。

31
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:05,720
You don't want to do that because you may end up with garbage.
你不想这样做，因为你可能会得到垃圾。

32
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,720
Preempt resources without killing of a thread.
在不终止线程的情况下，预先占用资源。

33
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,880
This means that the system has the ability to suspend a thread.
这意味着系统具有挂起线程的能力。

34
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:25,840
And then you can preempt that resource while that thread is suspended or is sleeping.
然后，在该线程被挂起或休眠时，您可以预占该资源。

35
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,920
And another thread can get that resource and again, complete the computation.
另一个线程可以获取该资源，并再次完成计算。

36
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,300
And when the thread which are suspended comes back, hopefully there are enough resources
而当被悬挂的线程回来时，希望有足够的资源。

37
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,880
for that type of computation.
对于那种类型的计算。

38
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,540
Rollback the actions.
回滚这些操作。

39
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,680
If you remember in our example, it's a bridge and you have two cars on a one line bridge
如果你还记得我们的例子，这是一座桥，桥上有两辆车，只有一条车道。

40
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,020
coming head to head in the middle of the bridge.
在桥的中间面对面相遇。

41
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:57,720
One way to resolve the problem is a deadlock is for one car to back up.
解决死锁问题的一种方法是让一辆车倒退。

42
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,160
And when you look at the operating system, some of them use some of these options.
当你看操作系统时，其中一些使用了这些选项中的一些。

43
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,760
Like for instance, when system hangs, right?
比如，当系统卡住的时候，对吗？

44
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,300
Typically when system hangs and you can't do anything about it, in some cases it's a
通常当系统卡住，你无法做任何操作时，在某些情况下，这是一个

45
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,300
deadlock.
死锁。

46
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,300
In many cases.
在许多情况下。

47
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,300
So how do you do it?
那么你是如何做到的呢？

48
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,360
You reboot it, right?
你重新启动它，对吗？

49
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,520
So you kill everything.
所以你杀掉一切。

50
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,780
And preempting resources, this operating system is doing that.
并且，这个操作系统正在预先占用资源。

51
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:34,900
You know threads are preempted, are put on the waiting queue.
你知道线程是被抢占的，被放入等待队列。

52
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:41,660
And yeah, these are a few examples.
是的，这些是一些例子。

53
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:49,460
So also we talk about another example last time.
所以我们上次也谈到了另一个例子。

54
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,420
Another way, obviously you can solve the deadlock problem if you have infinite resources, right?
另一种方式，显然如果你拥有无限资源，你就可以解决死锁问题，对吗？

55
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,820
If you have infinite resources means that every thread at any given time has all the
如果你拥有无限资源，意味着每个线程在任何给定的时间都拥有全部的资源。

56
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:05,620
resources it needs to continue to progress and to finish its computation.
资源它需要继续进展并完成计算。

57
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,460
And this is relevant here as an example about the second part of the lecture when we are
而这个例子在这里是相关的，作为讲座的第二部分的一个例子，当我们...

58
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,460
going to talk about virtual memory.
我将要讨论虚拟内存。

59
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:26,500
And because virtual memory, it provides you a memory which is much larger than the physical
并且由于虚拟内存，它为您提供了比物理内存更大的内存空间。

60
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,860
memory.
记忆。

61
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:39,100
You can think about for most applications, the same infinite space, infinite memory.
你可以想象对于大多数应用来说，有着无限的空间和无限的内存。

62
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:45,580
The one thing though is that as we will see under the hood of the virtual memory, the
一件事情是，当我们深入了解虚拟内存的内部机制时，我们会发现

63
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,920
virtual memory is implemented.
虚拟内存已经实现。

64
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:54,260
You are going to load different parts of the virtual memory in the physical memory.
你将会将虚拟内存的不同部分加载到物理内存中。

65
00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:01,460
And then you are going to offload to move some of the parts of the virtual memory of
然后你要卸载一些虚拟内存的部分来移动一些部件。

66
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:07,720
the threads which are not running off the physical memory.
非运行在物理内存中的线程。

67
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,180
You put them on the disk.
你把它们放在硬盘上。

68
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,760
And in doing so, you basically the solution under the hood is to preempt, right?
在这样做的过程中，你基本上是在暗中预先阻止解决方案，对吗？

69
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:24,200
You preempt the physical memory storage which contains a virtual memory data from one thread
你抢占了一个线程中包含虚拟内存数据的物理内存存储空间。

70
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,340
with another, with a virtual memory content of another thread.
与另一个线程一起，具有另一个线程的虚拟内存内容。

71
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:36,260
We'll talk more about that.
我们会更详细地讨论这个问题。

72
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:46,420
That is something, it's a nice relation between the deadlock solutions and virtual memory.
这是一件很有意思的事情，它展示了死锁解决方案和虚拟内存之间的良好关系。

73
00:06:46,420 --> 00:07:01,800
So the next mechanism of resolving the deadlock problem, it's deadlock avoidance, right?
是的，解决死锁问题的下一个机制是死锁避免，对吗？

74
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,820
And this is different from deadlock prevention, which we talked last time quite a bit.
这与我们上次谈论的死锁预防是不同的。

75
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:16,360
So deadlock prevention, if you remember, it design your program so that you never run
死锁预防，如果你还记得的话，它设计你的程序，使得你永远不会运行进入死锁状态。

76
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,980
into deadlock, right?
陷入僵局，对吗？

77
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:27,140
Like all the resources are going to be acquired in the same order by everyone, right?
所有资源都将按照相同的顺序被每个人获取，对吗？

78
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,140
Things like that.
这样的事情。

79
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:36,580
Now deadlock avoidance is basically is that it's more dynamic.
现在死锁避免基本上是更加动态的。

80
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:45,720
It's a more dynamic way to avoid, sorry, deadlock avoidance is a more dynamic way to avoid deadlocks.
这是一种更动态的避免方式，抱歉，避免死锁是一种更动态的避免死锁的方式。

81
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,400
And this is basically the operating system in this case.
这基本上就是在这种情况下的操作系统。

82
00:07:51,400 --> 00:08:00,040
It checks at everyone, you make every resource request, whether it can result in a deadlock.
它会检查每个人，你发出的每个资源请求，无论是否可能导致死锁。

83
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:10,680
And if the operating system convince itself that if it grants this request, there is a
并且如果操作系统自己相信，如果它满足这个请求，那么就会有一个

84
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:19,960
way in which you don't get into a deadlock state, then it's granting the resource to
如果你不陷入死锁状态的方式，那就是将资源授予。

85
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,160
the state which asks for it.
要求这一点的州。

86
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,760
Otherwise, it does not.
否则，它就不会。

87
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you would like to be translated.

88
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,800
Let me see the question here.
让我看看这里的问题。

89
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,600
Oh, sorry.
哦，抱歉。

90
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,120
That's a great question.
这是一个很好的问题。

91
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,440
The slides is my mistake.
这是我的错误。

92
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:48,520
Let me, okay, let me give me 30 seconds to upload them and they're going to be available
让我，好的，让我给我30秒的时间上传它们，然后它们就会可用了。

93
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,520
in a few moments.
片刻后。

94
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:59,240
Yeah, I apologize for that.
是的，我为此道歉。

95
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:06,260
Silence.
沉默。

96
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:20,360
Silence.
沉默。

97
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:43,340
Okay, so I pushed them so, you know, after a bit of time, they are going to be available.
好的，所以我催促了他们，你知道的，过了一段时间后，他们会可用的。

98
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,340
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

99
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
Sorry.
对不起。

100
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,340
And thanks for flagging it up.
并且谢谢你提醒我。

101
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

102
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you need to be translated.

103
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,340
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

104
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,340
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide the text you would like me to translate.

105
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,340
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you would like to be translated.

106
00:09:53,340 --> 00:10:00,300
So let's see how this, you know, in this example, it's like we gave this as a canonical example
所以让我们看看这个例子，你知道，在这个例子中，就像我们把这个作为一个典型的例子一样。

107
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,920
we used last time to illustrate the deadlock.
我们上次使用了一个例子来说明死锁。

108
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,620
And here, if you remember, you have two threads and both threads A and B acquire resources
在这里，如果你还记得的话，你有两个线程，线程A和线程B都获取了资源。

109
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:16,560
or the lock Y, X, and Y, but they acquire them in a different order.
或者锁定Y、X和Y，但是他们以不同的顺序获取它们。

110
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:25,380
So let's say thread A acquire X and let B acquire B. So thread B acquire Y.
所以假设线程A获取X，线程B获取B，然后线程B获取Y。

111
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,660
So in this case, it's not working.
所以在这种情况下，它不起作用。

112
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,740
You have deadlock, right?
你有死锁，对吗？

113
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:38,360
Because if Y tries to acquire, because if A tries to acquire Y, it can no longer do
因为如果Y试图收购，因为如果A试图收购Y，它将无法再这样做。

114
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,060
that because B already holds Y.
因为B已经持有Y。

115
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,060
Okay.
Sure. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

116
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,120
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

117
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,800
So this will, this doesn't work, right?
所以这个，这个不起作用，对吗？

118
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,260
So this is what we want to avoid.
这就是我们想要避免的。

119
00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:05,780
So in this particular case, the point here is that, you know, if you go back, once the
所以在这个特定的情况下，关键是，你知道的，如果你回过头来看，一旦

120
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:20,300
system allocated X to A, then it shouldn't, when B asks for Y, it should not grant access
系统将X分配给A，但当B请求Y时，不应该授予访问权限。

121
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,300
to that resource.
对于那个资源。

122
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,140
It shouldn't grant that the resource Y or the lock, right?
不应该授予资源Y或锁定，对吗？

123
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:33,620
Because if you grant it, now there is a potential for deadlock.
因为如果你批准了，现在就有可能陷入僵局。

124
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,740
Okay.
Sure. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

125
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:47,020
And now, intuitively, you see, if the operating system doesn't grant Y to B, then A has the
权限 (permission) to access the resource.

126
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:55,780
opportunity to request Y, and now the operating system can grant Y to A. So A now has both
机会请求Y，现在操作系统可以授予A Y。所以A现在拥有了两者。

127
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:04,600
X and Y, so can complete this computation and then release both X and Y, right?
X和Y，所以可以完成这个计算，然后释放X和Y，对吗？

128
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,420
So that's kind of what you want to happen.
所以这就是你想要发生的事情。

129
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,260
And this is exactly what the deadlock avoidance is trying to do.
这正是死锁避免所试图做的。

130
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,260
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you would like me to translate.

131
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,260
Intuitively.
直觉上来说。

132
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:23,020
So with the deadlock avoidance, you have two states, a safe state and a deadlock state.
所以在死锁避免中，你有两种状态，一种是安全状态，一种是死锁状态。

133
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,580
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you would like to be translated.

134
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:34,300
And in the safe state, means that there is a way to allocate the resources to the existing
并且在安全状态下，意味着有一种方法可以将资源分配给现有的资源。

135
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:41,220
threads such that every thread is going to complete.
线程，以便每个线程都能完成。

136
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,860
So there is no deadlock.
所以没有死锁。

137
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,800
Deadlock means there is a deadlock in the system.
死锁意味着系统中存在死锁。

138
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,520
So the four requirements we talk about are all hold.
所以我们所讨论的四个要求都得到满足。

139
00:12:52,520 --> 00:13:01,040
These are the two main states, and then there is another unsafe state.
这是两个主要的状态，然后还有另一个不安全的状态。

140
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:08,340
There is no deadlock yet, but threads can require resources in a pattern that unavoidable
目前还没有死锁，但线程可能以一种无法避免的模式需要资源。

141
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,640
leads to deadlock.
导致僵局。

142
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,660
So basically right now, there is no deadlock.
所以基本上现在没有死锁。

143
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,100
But the deadlock is imminent.
但是僵局即将来临。

144
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,960
You cannot do anything about it.
你对此无能为力。

145
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you would like to be translated.

146
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,640
You are on the way for the deadlock to happen.
你正在走向僵局的道路。

147
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

148
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,760
So this is what unsafe state.
这是一个不安全的状态。

149
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,840
Okay.
Sure. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

150
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:34,920
So with a deadlock avoidance, you just try to prevent the system from reaching an unsafe
因此，通过避免死锁，你只是试图防止系统进入不安全的状态。

151
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,400
state.
状态。

152
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,880
Because if you reach an unsafe state, eventually you are going to reach a deadlock state.
因为如果你达到了一个不安全的状态，最终你将会进入一个死锁状态。

153
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,520
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

154
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:51,200
And the main idea here is when a thread requests a resource, the operating system checks if
而这里的主要思想是当一个线程请求一个资源时，操作系统会检查是否

155
00:13:51,200 --> 00:14:00,920
it will result, if granting that resource would lead to an unsafe state.
如果授予资源会导致不安全的状态，那么将会产生这样的结果。

156
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,560
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide the text you would like me to translate.

157
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,480
If it will not lead to an unsafe state, it's going to grant the resource.
如果不会导致不安全的状态，它将会授予资源。

158
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:21,680
If not, it's not going to grant and is going to wait for the existing threads to finish
如果不是这样，它将不会授予并等待现有的线程完成。

159
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,780
and release some resource.
并释放一些资源。

160
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,520
So let again look at the previous example.
那么让我们再次看一下之前的例子。

161
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,360
And I already mentioned to you the solution, but let's do it again.
我已经向你提到了解决方案，但我们再来一次吧。

162
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,360
So thread A acquires X.
所以线程A获取了X。

163
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:51,720
Now thread B ask for Y, but we do not give Y to B until A finishes.
现在B线程要求Y，但在A完成之前我们不会将Y给予B。

164
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,880
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you would like to have translated.

165
00:14:52,880 --> 00:15:01,440
Because if we give grant Y to B, as you know, it can, it results in deadlock.
因为如果我们给予B Y的授权，正如你所知，这可能导致僵局。

166
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,880
And the classic algorithm for avoiding deadlock, it's a banker algorithms.
而避免死锁的经典算法是银行家算法。

167
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:19,480
And basically what you, you know, the idea here is that each thread is states the maximum
基本上，你知道的，这里的想法是每个线程都表达了最大值。

168
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,800
number of resources in its inner bass, right?
内部低音的资源数量，对吗？

169
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:36,140
And allow a thread to proceed only if available resources in the system minus requested resources
并且只有在系统中的可用资源减去所请求的资源后，才允许一个线程继续进行。

170
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:43,200
in the system is greater than the maximum number of resources required by a thread.
系统中的资源数量大于线程所需的最大资源数量。

171
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,880
Right.
对的。

172
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
And this is important.
这很重要。

173
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:53,440
You need to stay upfront how many resources you have, because if you don't, the system
你需要坦诚地说明你拥有多少资源，因为如果你不这样做，系统就会

174
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,160
doesn't have the information.
没有这个信息。

175
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:02,160
And at any given time in the future, you can, you being a thread, ask for more resources.
在未来的任何时候，作为一个线程，你可以请求更多的资源。

176
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Right.
对的。

177
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,440
So there is no way actually to protect the deadlock in this situation.
所以实际上没有办法保护这种死锁情况。

178
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,560
So banker algorithms allocate the resource dynamically.
银行家算法动态分配资源。

179
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:22,140
So he's looking at each request, resource request, and then it decide whether to grant
所以他会查看每个请求、资源请求，然后决定是否批准。

180
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:36,700
a request, a resource or not, if the resulting state remains a safe state.
一个请求，一个资源或者不是，如果结果状态仍然是一个安全状态。

181
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,920
And the techniques is very simple.
而且这些技巧非常简单。

182
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,700
You pretend that each request is granted.
你假装每个请求都被批准了。

183
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,660
Then you run the deadlock detection algorithm.
然后你运行死锁检测算法。

184
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:49,700
So you remember the last time we are looking, we are, we learn about deadlock detection
是的，我记得我们上次讨论的内容，我们学习了关于死锁检测的知识。

185
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,700
algorithm.
算法。

186
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,700
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

187
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,700
So it's very simple.
所以这很简单。

188
00:16:52,700 --> 00:17:01,040
In the deadlock detection algorithms, you are looking whether the requested resources
在死锁检测算法中，你正在查看请求的资源是否

189
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:07,380
by a particular thread are, it can be satisfied.
通过一个特定的线程，可以满足它。

190
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,760
So it's less than the resource availability.
所以它少于资源的可用性。

191
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Right.
正确的。

192
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:21,680
In this case, we are looking at how many more resources a thread needs in the worst case.
在这种情况下，我们正在考虑一个线程在最坏情况下需要多少更多的资源。

193
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:28,900
Which is a max node, is a node in the graph.
哪个是最大节点，是图中的一个节点。

194
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,740
And you know, that's why it's called node here.
而且你知道，这就是为什么这里被称为节点的原因。

195
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:40,620
But you can replace node with a thread, but the maximum number of resources that the thread
但是你可以用线程替换节点，但线程的最大资源数量

196
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:47,900
still needs is a maximum number of resources overall that thread needs minus the number
还需要的是线程总共需要的资源的最大数量减去数量。

197
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,620
of resources the thread already owns.
线程已经拥有的资源。

198
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,380
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you need to be translated.

199
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:02,340
So this is again, if you remember, this is the algorithms to detect the deadlock.
这是之前提到过的，如果你还记得的话，这是用于检测死锁的算法。

200
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:08,460
So the only change you need to make here is that we need to, we are going to replace request,
所以你需要做的唯一更改是，我们需要将"request"替换为...

201
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:18,540
number of request resources with the maximum number of resources that node or thread can
每个节点或线程可以请求的资源的最大数量。

202
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:25,740
still need, will still need in the worst case.
仍然需要，在最坏的情况下仍然需要。

203
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,820
So that's what it is.
这就是它的原因。

204
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,960
Right.
对的。

205
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,740
So just to look a little bit more at the code, you put all nodes, again, all threads in unfinished
所以再仔细看一下代码，你将所有的节点，再次将所有的线程放在未完成的状态下。

206
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:45,340
you have available resources, which is amount of the number of resources which are free
你有可用的资源，这是指可免费使用的资源数量。

207
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,780
in the system.
在系统中。

208
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:54,940
And then you are going to look at all nodes in unfinished, which are still computing.
然后你将查看所有在未完成中的节点，这些节点仍在计算中。

209
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:07,380
And for each of them, you are looking at that, you know, can if the amount of resources that
而对于每一个人，你正在考虑的是，你知道的，是否可以获得足够的资源量。

210
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:13,260
thread is going to require in, to ask for in the worst case is less than the available
线程将需要输入，在最坏的情况下要求的输入量少于可用的。

211
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,480
resources.
资源。

212
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,500
And if yes, is fine.
如果是的话，那就好。

213
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,260
You remove from unfinished because we know that we are looking at those resources with
你将未完成的内容移除了，因为我们知道我们正在查看那些资源。

214
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,060
the thread will finish for sure.
这个线程肯定会结束。

215
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,420
Right.
对的。

216
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,220
And we'll never ask for more resources than that.
我们永远不会要求超过这些资源。

217
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:38,740
And then you iterate and it's until you are done.
然后你进行迭代，直到完成。

218
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,740
Okay.
Sure, I'll do my best to assist you with your translations. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

219
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:39,740
Thank you.
谢谢你。

220
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,740
Thank you.
谢谢你。

221
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:40,740
Bye.
再见。

222
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,740
Bye.
再见。

223
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:52,610
Can you explain what a lock means?
"锁"是指一种用于固定或保护物品的装置。它通常由金属制成，具有可旋转或可插入的机械部件，用于将两个或多个物体连接在一起，以防止其移动或打开。锁的主要目的是提供安全和保护，防止未经授权的人或者未经许可的访问。

224
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,770
A lock means allocate--
锁的意思是分配。

225
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,890
a lock is the resources which are already
锁是已经被占用的资源。

226
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,050
allocated to a thread.
分配给一个线程。

227
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:04,850
So say I have a thread--
所以说我有一个线程--

228
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,850
so let me just go--
所以让我继续——

229
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,730
let me just--
让我只是——

230
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:13,690
nothing better than an example.
没有什么比一个例子更好的了。

231
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:27,450
OK, so in this example, both threads, the max will be 2,
好的，在这个例子中，两个线程的最大值将是2。

232
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,850
because they require x and y, right?
因为它们需要x和y，对吗？

233
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,730
Or it's a vector.
或者它是一个向量。

234
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,330
Depends how you want to look at it.
这取决于你想如何看待它。

235
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,810
But in this case, we understand both threads requires x and y.
但在这种情况下，我们理解两个线程都需要x和y。

236
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:42,490
This is the max, initially.
这是最大值，最初的时候。

237
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:49,930
Now, when the thread A gets x, in this case, x is alloc
现在，当线程A获得x时，在这种情况下，x被分配。

238
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,130
in the alloc--
在分配中--

239
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,290
allocated vector.
分配的向量。

240
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,730
So the amount is the number of resources
所以这个数量是资源的数量。

241
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,530
which are already allocated to the thread.
已经分配给线程的。

242
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,130
Max is still x and y.
Max仍然是x和y。

243
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:09,010
So when you do max, max, x and y, max minus alloc,
当你执行max、max、x和y时，max减去alloc。

244
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,530
in this case, you get what?
在这种情况下，你得到了什么？

245
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,930
You get y, because max is x and y.
你得到 y，因为最大值是 x 和 y。

246
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,850
Alloc is x.
Alloc is x. (Alloc是x。)

247
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,850
So you get y.
所以你得到了y。

248
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,490
So in this case, in the worst case,
那么在这种情况下，最坏的情况是，

249
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,690
that thread A still is going to ask for y.
那个帖子A仍然打算询问y。

250
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,170
OK?
好的。

251
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:54,850
the system in a safe state means
系统处于安全状态意味着

252
00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:01,810
that there exists a sequence in which your grand request
有这样一个序列，其中包含了你的宏伟请求。

253
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:07,490
to the threads which are unfinished so that all threads
将未完成的帖子置顶，以便所有帖子都能被看到。

254
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,330
are going to finish.
你们要完成了。

255
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:17,890
So let's apply this algorithms to the dining
所以让我们将这些算法应用于用餐。

256
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,970
philosopher problem or lawyer's problem.
哲学家问题或律师问题。

257
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:26,050
So what is a deadlock here?
这里的死锁是什么意思？

258
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:30,530
The deadlock here is that when each person picks a job stick
这里的僵局是每个人都选择一根工作棍时

259
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,650
and they have only one job stick,
他们只有一根工作棍。

260
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,970
there is no other job stick available, so no one can eat.
没有其他的工作机会，所以没有人能够谋生。

261
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,370
OK?
好的。

262
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,090
So what is a safe state here?
这里的"safe state"是什么意思？

263
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:46,450
Is that when you can grant a request to a job stick?
你是说当你能够满足一个工作要求时吗？

264
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,330
You can grant one is that there is not the last job stick.
你可以批准一个是没有最后一份工作的粘性。

265
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:54,570
Because if we have still one job stick,
因为如果我们还有一个工作岗位，

266
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,490
we can give that job stick to someone
我们可以把这个工作交给某人。

267
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,290
who has already one job stick.
谁已经有一份工作呢？

268
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,730
And that person is going to finish eating.
那个人要吃完了。

269
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,690
And now you get two chopsticks.
现在你拿到了两根筷子。

270
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:08,050
So you can give these chopsticks to other people to eat.
所以你可以把这些筷子给其他人用来吃饭。

271
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:12,050
OK?
好的。

272
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:16,690
Or this is the last job stick, but you give to someone
或者这是最后一根工作棍，但你把它给了别人。

273
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,570
who already has a job stick.
已经有工作的人。

274
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,170
Because if you do so, then that person,
因为如果你这样做，那个人，

275
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,450
you gave the second job stick, can finish eating.
你给了第二份工作的棒，可以完成。

276
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,370
OK?
好的。

277
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,850
OK?
好的。

278
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,930
What happens if you have--
如果你有什么情况发生--

279
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:39,610
you generalize the problem with K-handed people,
你概括了关于K手人的问题，

280
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,490
like octopus?
喜欢章鱼吗？

281
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,330
Think about like you have octopuses which are dying.
想象一下，你有一些正在死去的章鱼。

282
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:48,570
You can generalize that.
你可以概括一下。

283
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:53,330
So basically, the last one and no one could have K.
所以基本上，最后一个人是无法击败的。

284
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:57,170
It's the second to last one, and no one have K minus 1,
这是倒数第二个，没有人有K减1。

285
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,530
and so forth.
等等。

286
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,650
Right?
对吗？

287
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:05,090
Because otherwise, if you allocate--
因为否则，如果你分配--

288
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:10,650
if you grant the chopstick by violating
如果你通过违反规定来授予筷子

289
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:16,810
any of these conditions, then you can end up in that lock.
如果满足这些条件中的任何一个，你就会陷入那种困境。

290
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,650
So in summary, there are four conditions.
所以总结一下，有四个条件。

291
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,930
By the way, any questions about Banker's algorithm?
顺便问一下，对于银行家算法有什么问题吗？

292
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:42,330
So again, at the high level, the idea is very simple.
所以，再次说，从高层次来看，这个想法非常简单。

293
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,890
Each thread is going to tell you in advance,
每个线程都会提前告诉你，

294
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:52,930
to say in advance, how many resources it needs.
提前说一下，它需要多少资源。

295
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:56,570
And then what you do, the operating system
然后你做什么，操作系统

296
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:01,810
is going to grant a request to a resource.
将要批准对某资源的请求。

297
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:06,730
If by granting that request, you remain in safe state.
如果通过满足那个请求，你能保持安全状态。

298
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:11,650
And in safe state means that there
并且处于安全状态意味着

299
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,570
is a way to grant the request to the existing threads,
是一种向现有线程授予请求的方法。

300
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,530
such that every thread is going to finish.
以至于每个线程都会完成。

301
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:28,890
What is K minus 2?
K减去2等于多少？

302
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:35,970
So here, K minus 2, here you assume
那么，在这里，K减2，你在这里假设

303
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,930
that instead of having two hands, that person or entity
那个人或实体不是有两只手，而是

304
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,290
will have K hands.
将有K只手。

305
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:55,770
And in order to eat that octopus, it needs OK chopsticks.
而为了吃那个章鱼，需要好用的筷子。

306
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:06,610
So if you have one chopstick left,
那么如果你只剩下一根筷子，

307
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,690
and someone else asks for the chopstick,
然后另外一个人要求要筷子，

308
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,970
you do not give that chopstick to that person.
你不要把那根筷子给那个人。

309
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:22,610
Unless that person has K chopsticks.
除非那个人有K型筷子。

310
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:28,410
And the same next, if you have two chopsticks, which
而且接下来，如果你有两根筷子，那么

311
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:34,210
are not allocated, you would not give that chopstick
没有分配，你不会给那根筷子。

312
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,650
to a person unless at least one other person
除非至少还有其他人在场，否则不要对一个人这样做。

313
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,530
has K minus 1 chopsticks.
有K-1根筷子。

314
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:45,650
Because otherwise, if you give the chopstick
因为否则，如果你给筷子

315
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,530
to another person, and none of the person
给另一个人，而不是这个人。

316
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,970
has K minus 1 chopsticks, they have K minus 2 or less,
他有K-1根筷子，他们有K-2根或更少。

317
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,970
now you are in unsafe state.
现在你处于不安全的状态。

318
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,090
Because you have only one chopstick left,
因为你只剩下一根筷子了，

319
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,490
and no one else has more than K minus 2 chopsticks.
而且没有其他人拥有超过K减2根筷子。

320
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,050
So no matter to whom I am going to give the last chopstick,
所以无论我要把最后一根筷子给谁，

321
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,250
no one else can eat.
没有其他人可以吃。

322
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,530
No one can eat.
没有人可以吃饭。

323
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,030
OK?
好的。

324
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:19,250
So there are four conditions for deadlock to happen.
所以发生死锁有四个条件。

325
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,650
Mutual exclusion, hold on weight, no preemption,
互斥、持有权重、无抢占。

326
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,730
and circular weight.
和圆形的重物。

327
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,330
And there are several techniques to addressing the deadlock
并且有几种解决死锁的技术。

328
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,650
problem.
问题。

329
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:33,610
Deadlock prevention, you write your code in a way
死锁预防，你需要以一种方式编写你的代码

330
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,010
that it's not prone to the deadlock.
它不容易发生死锁。

331
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:43,050
You set up some rules so that if everyone respects these rules,
你设立了一些规则，以便如果每个人都遵守这些规则，

332
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,970
you cannot have deadlock, for instance.
你不能有死锁，例如。

333
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:52,410
Deadlock recovery, you let the deadlock happen and then
死锁恢复，你让死锁发生，然后...

334
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,810
figure out how to recover.
找出如何恢复。

335
00:27:54,810 --> 00:28:01,050
You can preempt a thread, you can suspend a thread,
你可以抢占一个线程，你可以暂停一个线程，

336
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,050
you can roll back.
你可以回滚。

337
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:08,050
Deadlock avoidance, this is what we just learned,
死锁避免，这是我们刚刚学到的内容。

338
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:13,370
the banker algorithms, which then you basically
银行家算法，基本上就是这样

339
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:16,050
delay resource requests.
延迟资源请求。

340
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,290
So deadlock doesn't happen.
所以死锁不会发生。

341
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:23,570
And finally, of course, deadlock denial,
最后，当然还有僵局否认。

342
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,930
you just ignore this deadlock because it may never happen.
你只需要忽略这个死锁问题，因为它可能永远不会发生。

343
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:30,290
Or this happens so infrequently, and when it happens,
或者这种情况发生得如此罕见，而且当它发生时，

344
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,930
there is not a big issue.
没有什么大问题。

345
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:37,610
So announcements.
公告。

346
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,410
Project one, congrats for completing your first project.

347
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:48,330
So we are planning to release the grades for your midterm

348
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,410
by Monday, like I mentioned last time.
到星期一，就像我上次提到的那样。

349
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:54,090
And project two will be released today.
并且项目二将在今天发布。

350
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,170
So good luck for project two.
祝你在项目二中好运。

351
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:02,730
So now I am going to switch gears,
所以现在我要换个话题，

352
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:09,490
and I am going to talk about virtual memory.
我将要谈论虚拟内存。

353
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:14,850
And we'll start to remind everyone
然后我们将开始提醒每个人。

354
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,890
to recall about virtualizing resources.
回顾虚拟化资源。

355
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,330
Memory is just another resource which you visualize.
记忆只是另一种你可以可视化的资源。

356
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,970
But before then, let me stop and ask you
但在那之前，让我停下来问你一下。

357
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,770
whether you have any questions about what
你对这件事有没有任何问题？

358
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,330
we've learned so far or any other question.
我们迄今为止学到的东西或者其他问题。

359
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:45,650
OK, so it seems there are no questions.
好的，所以看起来没有问题。

360
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,210
So let's go ahead.
那么我们继续吧。

361
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:58,010
So remember that what we want in the operating system
所以记住，在操作系统中我们想要的是什么。

362
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,890
was to provide to the application
是为了提供给应用程序。

363
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,730
is the illusion that each application has
是每个应用程序都有的错觉

364
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,210
its own machine on which it runs.
它有自己的机器，上面运行着。

365
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,770
It has its own resources.
它有自己的资源。

366
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,810
But of course, the physical machines
当然，这些物理机器

367
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,890
have limited resources.
资源有限。

368
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:20,490
So therefore, you need to kind of virtualize
所以，你需要进行一种虚拟化的操作。

369
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,930
this virtual machine, this physical machine,
这个虚拟机，这个物理机器，

370
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:28,210
to different applications, different processes, which
对于不同的应用程序，不同的流程，这是很常见的。

371
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,770
means that virtualization means that you need--
这意味着虚拟化意味着你需要--

372
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:36,850
if you have more application or more processes, which
如果你有更多的应用程序或更多的进程，那么

373
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:41,290
is a common case, then the physical resources,
是一个常见的情况，然后是物理资源，

374
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:46,330
the only way you can visualize resources is to multiplex them.
唯一的方式是通过复用来可视化资源。

375
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:49,290
And you can multiplex them in space or in time.
你可以在空间或时间上对它们进行多路复用。

376
00:30:53,290 --> 00:31:00,450
So one classic example about virtualizing in time is CPU.
所以一个关于时间虚拟化的经典例子就是CPU。

377
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,730
You multiplex the CPU so that in time quanta,
你将CPU进行多路复用，以便在时间量子中，

378
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:08,290
so for each time quanta, you let another process run.
所以对于每个时间片，你让另一个进程运行。

379
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:11,290
And therefore, each process has the illusion
所以，每个过程都有幻觉。

380
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:18,130
that it owns a CPU, a slower CPU than the physical CPU.
它拥有一个CPU，一个比物理CPU慢的CPU。

381
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:27,690
The second one is another important resource is memory.
第二个重要资源是记忆。

382
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,890
And this is what we are going to start learning about today,
而这就是我们今天要开始学习的内容，

383
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,890
how to virtualize the memory.
如何虚拟化内存。

384
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,930
And the other important one is a disk or storage.
另一个重要的是磁盘或存储设备。

385
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:45,570
Now, why memory is important?
现在，为什么记忆很重要呢？

386
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,170
Why do you want to virtualize memory?
为什么你想要虚拟化内存？

387
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,050
Of course.
当然。

388
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:53,450
It's very important because the entire state of a process
这非常重要，因为一个过程的整个状态

389
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,170
or application is stored--
或应用程序存储在哪里？

390
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,810
or not entire state, but most of the state or the active state,
或者不是整个州，而是大部分州或活跃的州，

391
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:04,650
the state which is used by the process when it runs,
进程运行时使用的状态

392
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,210
is stored in memory and registers.
存储在内存和寄存器中。

393
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:17,330
And therefore, as you know, you cannot have two threads use
因此，正如你所知，你不能让两个线程同时使用。

394
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,170
the same memory.
相同的记忆。

395
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:32,170
Always use the same memory because it's, again,
永远使用相同的内存

396
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,570
like two different pieces of data cannot
好的，我明白了。翻译结果如下：

像两个不同的数据片段无法

397
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,410
occupy the same location.
占据相同的位置。

398
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:41,930
And you don't want--
而且你不想要--

399
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,890
sometimes, you don't want threads
有时候，你不想要线程。

400
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:47,810
to have access to each other memory.
互相访问彼此的记忆。

401
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,410
And here, you have memory protection.
这里，你有内存保护。

402
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,970
And remember, how do you provide memory protection?
记住，你是如何提供内存保护的？

403
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:56,930
You provide them-- we are going to see the mechanics here.
你提供他们 - 我们将在这里看到机械师。

404
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:00,250
But the abstraction is a process.
但是抽象是一个过程。

405
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,530
Each process is its own memory.
每个进程都有自己的内存。

406
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:07,050
All the threads in the same process share that memory.
同一进程中的所有线程共享该内存。

407
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,010
Threads in the different processes
不同进程中的线程

408
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:13,730
cannot share the memory, cannot see each other memory, cannot
无法共享内存，无法看到彼此的内存，无法

409
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,850
access each other memory.
互相访问彼此的内存。

410
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:21,810
So OK.
好的。

411
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,650
Now, going back and recalling the four fundamental OS
现在，回顾并回忆起四个基本的操作系统。

412
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,210
concepts, we have thread, which is execution context.
概念，我们有线程，它是执行上下文。

413
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:38,370
It represents the control state, which
它代表了控制状态，该状态下

414
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,930
is program counter, registers, everything
程序计数器、寄存器，一切都是。

415
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:45,850
which is needed to execute that thread.
需要执行该线程的东西。

416
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:52,650
Then is the address space, which owns the entire memory,
然后是地址空间，它拥有整个内存。

417
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:57,290
accessible by the program for accessing means read and write.
可访问的意味着程序可以进行读写操作。

418
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:06,010
Then is a process, which is an instance of a running program.
然后是一个进程，它是一个正在运行的程序的实例。

419
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:12,650
And the process, it's address space plus one more thread.
并且这个过程，它的地址空间再加上一个线程。

420
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,410
And then we have this dual operation,
然后我们有这个双重操作，

421
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:20,330
dual mode operation between the system and user.
系统和用户之间的双模式操作。

422
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:24,930
And the system has the ability to access
并且该系统具有访问的能力。

423
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:31,650
more resources than the user, user programs.
比用户拥有更多的资源，用户程序。

424
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:44,970
So let's talk then about virtualized memory.
那么我们来谈谈虚拟化内存吧。

425
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:53,210
First, let's start with the concept of address space
首先，让我们从地址空间的概念开始。

426
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,450
and address translation.
和地址转换。

427
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:06,170
An address space is a set of a contiguous set
地址空间是一组连续的集合。

428
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:10,610
of memory addresses, which are seen
内存地址，这些地址是可见的

429
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,090
by the process or the application.
通过过程或应用。

430
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:23,850
Typically, the unit for memory is byte,
通常，内存的单位是字节。

431
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:29,410
and the size is expressed in power of two.
并且尺寸以2的幂次表示。

432
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,970
So for instance, if you have 2 power 10 bytes,
那么，例如，如果你有2个10次方字节的数据，

433
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:39,610
this means you have 1,024 bytes, which
这意味着你有1,024字节，其中

434
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:46,530
is one kilobyte, with capital B. Capital B stands for byte.
是一个千字节，用大写字母B表示。大写字母B代表字节。

435
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,530
A byte has eight bits.
一个字节有八个比特。

436
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:56,610
And then you have an address.
然后你有一个地址。

437
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:01,130
And the address is used to access individual bytes
并且地址用于访问单个字节。

438
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:04,530
in this address space.
在这个地址空间中。

439
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:09,010
Again, the number of bits in the address
再次，地址中的位数

440
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:14,530
is basically in this case is k or 10 in this example.
在这种情况下，"is basically"的意思是在这个例子中，"k"或者"10"。

441
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:21,130
It's the exponent of two when you define compute the memory
这是在计算内存时定义的二的指数。

442
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,210
size.
尺寸。

443
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,970
And this should be very easy to remember.
这个应该很容易记住。

444
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:33,490
If you have n addresses, how many bits you need
如果你有n个地址，你需要多少位？

445
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,610
to encode these n addresses?
对这些n个地址进行编码？

446
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,130
A bit has two values, 0 and 1.
一个比特有两个值，0和1。

447
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,330
So you need log of n.
所以你需要n的对数。

448
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,010
In this case, n is 2k.
在这种情况下，n等于2k。

449
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:50,050
Log base 2 of 2k is k.
以2为底的2k的对数是k。

450
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,770
How many bits of address each byte--
每个字节有多少位的地址？

451
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:58,330
bits of address-- how many bits you
地址位数--你需要多少位

452
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,690
need to address each byte in a four kilobyte page?
需要处理一个四千字节的页面中的每个字节吗？

453
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:06,610
Is 12, right?
是12吗？

454
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:11,650
Because 2 power 12 is four kilobytes.
因为2的12次方等于四千字节。

455
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:17,530
And obviously, if you have 20 bits to address,
而且显然，如果你有20位来寻址，

456
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:25,810
you can address 2 power 20 bytes.
你可以寻址2的20次方字节。

457
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,410
If you have 32 bits, you can address 2 power 32 bytes
如果你有32位，你可以寻址2的32次方字节。

458
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,210
and so forth.
等等。

459
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:42,730
But this is what a process see, a contiguous set of addresses.
但这是一个进程所看到的，一组连续的地址。

460
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,570
And typically, at each address, you have one byte.
通常情况下，每个地址都有一个字节。

461
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,170
You can store one byte.
你可以存储一个字节。

462
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,530
One byte is eight bits.
一个字节等于八位。

463
00:37:48,530 --> 00:38:00,290
And then the process uses this address space
然后该过程使用这个地址空间。

464
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,130
to store various information, code and data.
存储各种信息、代码和数据。

465
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:13,570
An accessible address-- accessible addresses
一个易于访问的地址--易于访问的地址

466
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:20,090
are all the addresses a process can read and write or write,
一个进程可以读取或写入的地址，是所有的地址吗？还是只有写入的地址？

467
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,650
and the state associated with them.
和与之相关的状态。

468
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,770
So what is stored at that particular address?
那个特定地址存储了什么内容？

469
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:33,330
In some cases, we are also measuring or give
在某些情况下，我们也在测量或给予

470
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:39,290
the size of a memory in words.
一个内存的大小，以字为单位。

471
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:46,810
And a word typically has more than one byte.
一个字通常有多个字节。

472
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:53,130
So for instance, a four word is 32 bits.
所以例如，一个四字节是32位。

473
00:38:53,130 --> 00:39:01,370
So one question here is, how many 32-bit numbers or four-byte
所以这里有一个问题，有多少个32位数字或四字节的数字。

474
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:07,770
words you can fit in an address space of--
地址空间可以容纳的字数为--

475
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:11,690
with 32 bits, right?
是的，32位的对吗？

476
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:18,210
Well, you have 32 bits, so you have 2 power 32 bytes.
好的，你有32位，所以你有2的32次方字节。

477
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,970
You need to divide by 4, because a word is 4 bytes,
你需要除以4，因为一个字是4个字节。

478
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,130
so you get 2 power 30, which is 1 billion.
所以你得到的是2的30次方，也就是10亿。

479
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:32,450
Now, we are going to--
现在，我们要--

480
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:38,740
more about that, but just for you to know that when you read and write to an address,
更多关于这个的信息，但是你需要知道的是，当你读取和写入一个地址时，

481
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:46,420
there are many things can happen. The most natural thing is that you read and write
有很多事情可能发生。最自然的事情是你读书和写作。

482
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:54,100
that particular piece of data, which is associated with the address that you read and write.
与您所读写的地址相关联的特定数据。

483
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:05,140
But other things could happen. You can actually, when you write to special designated addresses,
但是其他事情也可能发生。实际上，当你写信给特定指定的地址时，

484
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:14,500
or you read from special designated addresses, you can read and write to some device like display.
或者你可以从特定的指定地址读取，你可以读写一些设备，比如显示器。

485
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:25,220
And these are memory mapped IO operations, they are called. It can cause a program to abort.
这些是内存映射IO操作，它们被称为。它可能导致程序中止。

486
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:33,460
When is a program or do segfault? When this can happen, when does program segfault?
A program can segfault when it attempts to access a memory location that it is not allowed to access, or when it tries to perform an illegal operation. This can happen when there are bugs or errors in the program's code, such as dereferencing a null pointer or accessing an array out of bounds. When a program encounters such issues, it may result in a segmentation fault (segfault).

487
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:39,620
You should know by now. You've done
你现在应该知道了。你已经做过了。

488
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:47,780
homeworks, projects, I'm sure that many of you had this unfortunate experience.
作业，项目，我相信你们中的许多人都有过这种不幸的经历。

489
00:40:49,620 --> 00:41:08,580
And map memory. Yeah, so basically, if I'm trying to access an address, which is not accessible to me.
和地图记忆。是的，基本上，如果我试图访问一个对我来说不可访问的地址。

490
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:13,460
I'm going to read from and write from an address which is not accessible to me.
我将从一个对我不可访问的地址读取和写入。

491
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:25,620
So that's one. So some addresses owned by other processes.
所以这是一个。所以一些地址是其他进程拥有的。

492
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:42,660
OK, so as you know, in the address space, there are four important segments for each process.
好的，正如你所知，在地址空间中，每个进程有四个重要的段。

493
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:48,340
You have the code segment, which contains a code you are going to execute.
你有一个代码片段，其中包含一个你要执行的代码。

494
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:59,940
The stack segment, which you know it's used to push the return addresses when you call a function
堆栈段，你知道它用于在调用函数时推送返回地址。

495
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:10,980
and also pass the arguments to that function, is a heap for dynamically allocating memory.
并且还将参数传递给该函数，是用于动态分配内存的堆。

496
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:23,460
And it's static data, which is for what? For static data, as it implies, like global variables.
这是静态数据，用于什么？静态数据，顾名思义，就像全局变量一样。

497
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:37,620
You've seen this picture many, many times. I apologize for showing you again.
你已经看过这张照片很多很多次了。我很抱歉再次给你看。

498
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:46,660
But if you remember the relation, this shows you again the relation between a process and a thread.
但是如果你记得这个关系，这再次展示了进程和线程之间的关系。

499
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:52,820
A process can have multiple threads.
一个进程可以有多个线程。

500
00:42:52,820 --> 00:43:05,460
All threads in the same process share resources, including most of the memory resources,
所有在同一个进程中的线程共享资源，包括大部分的内存资源。

501
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:19,220
including heap, static, and code segments. The only one segment they don't share is the stack
包括堆、静态和代码段。他们唯一不共享的段是栈。

502
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:25,940
and the registers, obviously. And the reason you don't share the stack, because again, the stack
和寄存器，显然。而你不共享栈的原因是，再次，栈

503
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:32,420
contains the state of the execution. If you call a function in the thread,
包含执行状态。如果在线程中调用一个函数，

504
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:43,540
then you have to push the return on the stack. So now that represents the execution state of that
然后你需要将返回值推入堆栈。这样，堆栈就代表了该执行状态。

505
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:50,260
thread. And you can also have a single-threaded process, which has a single thread.
线程。你还可以有一个单线程的进程，它只有一个线程。

506
00:43:50,260 --> 00:44:02,020
There are three important aspects of memory multiplexing. One is protection. You prevent a
有三个关键方面与内存复用相关。其中之一是保护。你可以防止一个

507
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:14,660
process from accessing the data of another process. The second one is translation.
从访问另一个进程的数据开始的过程。第二个是翻译。

508
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:24,420
It's the ability to translate from a virtual address space to a physical address space.
这是从虚拟地址空间到物理地址空间的转换能力。

509
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:32,420
We'll learn about it. Okay. And when this translation occurs, you are going to have
我们会了解这个。好的。当这个翻译发生时，你会有什么？

510
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:40,740
these virtual addresses. And this can be used to avoid overlap or talk next,
这些虚拟地址。这可以用来避免重叠或者进行下一步的交流。

511
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:46,900
provide a uniform view to the program, to the process.
提供一个统一的视角给程序，给流程。

512
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:59,940
And also can be used to provide protection. And the control overlap is
并且还可以用来提供保护。而且控制重叠是什么意思？

513
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:09,780
it's separate state of the thread should not collide in physical memory.
线程的独立状态在物理内存中不应该发生冲突。

514
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:15,540
So this means that again, we have only one physical memory in the same
这意味着我们再次只有同一个物理内存。

515
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:26,900
on a single machine. So you have different processes, different threads. They shouldn't
在一台单独的机器上。所以你有不同的进程，不同的线程。它们不应该

516
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:38,100
collide. They shouldn't, for instance, share the same data segments.
碰撞。例如，它们不应该共享相同的数据段。

517
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:53,220
So an alternative view is to have to look at what is the allowable process behavior,
因此，另一种观点是要考虑可允许的过程行为是什么。

518
00:45:53,220 --> 00:46:00,260
what you allow process to do. And
你允许进程做什么。而且

519
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:14,740
this, what is allowed to do, it's regulated by the operating system, as you know.
这个

520
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:22,660
So the operating system in one way, it's interposing itself. So to make sure that the
操作系统在某种程度上是在干涉自己。为了确保

521
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:30,100
processes are well behaved. That's why the processes do not do anything bad.
进程表现良好。这就是为什么进程不会做任何坏事。

522
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:38,260
So the operating system is handling the I/O operations on the behalf of the processes.
所以操作系统代表进程处理输入输出操作。

523
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:44,500
It makes sure that every process gets access to the CPU.
它确保每个进程都能访问到CPU。

524
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:54,260
And like we'll see, it's going to make sure that each process, it gets its own
并且正如我们将会看到的，它将确保每个过程都有自己的。

525
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:59,140
physical memory under the hood. Okay.
底层的物理内存。好的。

526
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:04,180
So the question is, how do you enforce that?
那么问题是，你如何执行这个要求呢？

527
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:14,820
In the previous two cases, the operating system, as you know, is like this requires a context
在之前的两个案例中，操作系统，如你所知，是需要一个上下文的。

528
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:24,900
switch, right? I/O operation, it's a Cisco, it's a context switch. For the CPU, to share them,
开关，对吗？I/O操作，它是一台思科设备，是一个上下文切换。对于CPU来说，是为了共享它们，

529
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:30,980
to multiplex the CPU between different processes or threads, we need to do context switch, right?
要在不同的进程或线程之间复用CPU，我们需要进行上下文切换，对吗？

530
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:37,300
And context switch, remember, it's very, it's expensive. It can be tens of thousands,
而且上下文切换，记住，这是非常昂贵的。它可能需要数万美元，

531
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:43,540
hundreds of thousands of instructions. So now the question here is what about the memory?
数十万条指令。所以现在的问题是关于内存的情况如何？

532
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:49,060
It doesn't seem that the memory, you can do that on every access to the memory.
似乎并不是每次访问内存时都能做到这一点。

533
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:59,620
It's too expensive. So you need to have another way to make this kind of translation to interpose,
这太贵了。所以你需要找另一种方式来进行这种翻译插入。

534
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:04,900
to have this interposition layer between the virtual memory and the physical memory.
需要在虚拟内存和物理内存之间添加这个中间层。

535
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:13,860
And if there are exception cases, like you'll see, like page fault, we'll see that, then you can give
如果有异常情况，比如你会看到，比如页面错误，我们会看到，那么你可以给出

536
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:19,860
the control to the operating system. You can have the operating system interposing itself.
操作系统对控制的掌控。你可以让操作系统介入其中。

537
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,100
We'll learn about that, OK?
我们会学习那个，好吗？

538
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:31,380
Please again, this is a previous picture you're seeing in one of the first lectures.
请再看一次，这是在最早的几节课中你看到的一张以前的图片。

539
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:41,540
Everything here in this big box, it's hardware in the operating system, and it with this big box
这个大盒子里的一切，都是硬件和操作系统，它与这个大盒子一起。

540
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:50,340
provides a virtualization of the OS and of the machine to the application. That's all
提供了对操作系统和机器的虚拟化，供应用程序使用。就是这样。

541
00:48:50,340 --> 00:49:03,780
of the operating system. So, and just for big picture, what happens under the hood when you
操作系统的工作原理。所以，总体来说，当你在底层进行操作时会发生什么呢？

542
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:12,740
execute a program, if you remember, you copy the program, it's on the disk, right? You copy the code
执行一个程序，如果你记得的话，你复制了这个程序，它在磁盘上，对吗？你复制了代码。

543
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:22,420
in the memory and then you start executing. So let's see what happens when you execute. And here
在内存中，然后你开始执行。让我们看看执行时会发生什么。在这里

544
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:38,420
it's a very snippet of assembly language. And basically what happens here, you load
这是一段非常简短的汇编语言代码。基本上，这里发生的是，你加载了一些数据。

545
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:47,940
some from this address data one, you load the data which is there in register R1,
从这个地址数据中，你加载寄存器R1中的数据。

546
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:58,340
and depending on the value, you are going to jump to this address. Otherwise, you are going to
并且根据数值的不同，你将跳转到这个地址。否则，你将会

547
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:07,300
decrement the value and then you are going to look, you go to until it's not zero, B and Z means
递减该值，然后你要查看，直到它不为零，B和Z代表什么？

548
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:17,620
R1 is not zero, you go back, right? So basically, as long as it's not, and when it's zero, you jump
R1不是零，你回去，对吗？所以基本上，只要它不是零，当它是零时，你跳转。

549
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:30,180
out of, you terminate, right? So basically again, this code, take a piece of data, checks it,
你退出了，对吗？所以基本上，这段代码再次获取一段数据，检查它，

550
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:41,780
and then you decrement it and then you look, you go back.
然后你将其减小，然后你查看，你回退。

551
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:52,500
So what is in memory for this program or do you store? So in memory, you have only bits, right?
这个程序在内存中存储了什么内容？在内存中，你只有位(bit)，对吗？

552
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:57,220
And this is an example here.
这是一个例子。

553
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:06,260
And you have two columns for the physical address. The column on the left are the addresses
而且你有两列用于物理地址。左边的一列是地址。

554
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:13,540
and the column on the right are the content, is the content of the node.
右侧的列是内容，是节点的内容。

555
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:22,100
In this memory layout, we are using four byte words. How do you see that?
在这个内存布局中，我们使用四字节的字。你怎么看？

556
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:29,220
You see this number here on the right, 0000, you know, you have one, two, three, four, five, six,
你看到右边的这个数字，0000，你知道，你有一、二、三、四、五、六，

557
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:35,780
zero, seven, and twenty. So you have eight characters. Each of these characters
零、七和二十。所以你有八个字符。每个字符

558
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:49,220
represent eight bits, sorry, represent four bits, right? So it's a hexadecimal format.
表示八位，抱歉，表示四位，对吗？所以这是一个十六进制格式。

559
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:57,700
So it's from zero to F, each of these is from zero to F. So you have eight of them,
所以它从零到F，每个都是从零到F。所以你有八个。

560
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:06,020
eight times four, it's 32 bits. So you have 32 bits word or four byte word.
八乘以四等于32位。所以你有32位的字或者四字节的字。

561
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:19,460
The things with the red are the addresses which also appear in the program. You have three
红色的东西是地址，也出现在程序中。你有三个。

562
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:30,340
addresses, four addresses. One is the address for this data one. This is red. The blue one is
地址，四个地址。其中一个是这个数据的地址。这是红色的。蓝色的是另一个地址。

563
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:37,460
the check it address. And the green one, it's a loop address.
这个地址是检查地址。而那个绿色的，是一个循环地址。

564
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:57,540
OK. So now, tell me now, I said that, say take with the red, I said that this 00C0,
好的。现在告诉我，我说过，说拿红色的，我说这个00C0。

565
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:07,620
which is a program refers to this 0300. Can you figure out how these are connected
这个程序指的是0300。你能找出它们之间的联系吗？

566
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:17,940
and why they are connected? Why basically the same thing?
为什么它们相互连接？为什么基本上是同一件事情？

567
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:38,660
OK, so here it is.
好的，这是它。

568
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:55,140
If you address the memory at 32 bits boundaries, so an address as the word granularity,
如果您按32位边界访问内存，那么地址以字为粒度。

569
00:53:55,140 --> 00:54:06,980
each of these four bytes. OK, you need four times fewer addresses. OK, that's what it is.
每个字节都是这四个字节中的一个。好的，你只需要四分之一的地址。好的，就是这样。

570
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:14,100
So that's basically what happens here. When the program is going to
所以基本上就是这样。当程序要进行...

571
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:25,300
do your compiles the program and when you allocate the memory, everything happens at four word,
你编译程序并分配内存时，所有操作都是以四个字为单位进行的。

572
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:34,980
four byte granularity or 32 bits granularity. So therefore, at this granularity, you need
四字节粒度或32位粒度。因此，在这个粒度下，你需要

573
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:49,540
four times fewer, so to speak, addresses or bits. So this is what happens here. So 00C0 is 0300,
四分之一，可以这么说，地址或位数。所以这就是在这里发生的事情。所以00C0就是0300，

574
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:56,420
but is at 32 bits granularity instead of at the 8 bit or byte granularity.
但是它以32位粒度而不是8位或字节粒度进行。

575
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:06,180
Indeed, if you multiply C0 by four, you get 300.
确实，如果你将C0乘以四，你会得到300。

576
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:17,140
Any questions here?
这里有什么问题吗？

577
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:32,500
OK, so the same for the other one. If you multiply 280, you are going to get
好的，另一个也一样。如果你乘以280，你会得到多少？

578
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,940
800. If you multiply 0242 by four, you get 0908.
800. 如果你将0242乘以四，你会得到0908。

579
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:48,340
And now this is how these values are stored in the physical memory. It's another way,
现在这些值是如何存储在物理内存中的。这是另一种方式，

580
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:57,620
another representation. Right, so you have the values in these boxes and the addresses on the
另一种表示方法。对的，所以这些盒子里有数值，地址在上面。

581
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:10,340
side. So now here is a question. Say I am running this program and this program loads into physical
内存中的程序。

582
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:18,020
memory. And this addresses, right, because these are the addresses maybe in the program.
内存。这个地址，对吧，因为这些可能是程序中的地址。

583
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:25,060
On the disk. If I run again this program.
在磁盘上。如果我再次运行这个程序。

584
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:30,500
What will happen? Right.
会发生什么？对的。

585
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:40,580
If I run again this program, I don't want to load to be loaded exactly in the same place.
如果我再次运行这个程序，我不希望加载的位置完全相同。

586
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:46,820
Right, because a different instance of the program.
对，因为是程序的不同实例。

587
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,940
Like different data.
喜欢不同的数据。

588
00:56:49,940 --> 00:57:00,980
So that's one of the problems we need to solve. We need this translation. Right.
所以这是我们需要解决的问题之一。我们需要这个翻译。对的。

589
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:07,780
So one way to do the translation. So instead of I modify these addresses with this nuance,
所以有一种方法可以进行翻译。所以，我不是修改这些地址，而是用这种细微差别来翻译。

590
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:16,580
and now all these other addresses will not overlap with the previous instance. They are going to not
和现在所有这些其他地址将不会与之前的实例重叠。它们将不会

591
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:23,700
overlap, to be non-overlapping. And you are going to be able to load the second time you run the
重叠，不重叠。当你第二次运行时，你将能够加载。

592
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:32,260
same program at a different address space. So the two programs now, they don't step on each other.
在不同的地址空间中运行相同的程序。因此，现在这两个程序彼此不会冲突。

593
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:47,620
OK. So, you know, there are many way to, you know, the possible way to translate. This is
好的。所以，你知道，有很多种方式可以，你知道，进行翻译。这是一种可能的方式。

594
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:58,100
only one possibility, of course. So translation can happen at two times. The link time.
只有一种可能性，当然。所以翻译可以在两个时间进行。链接时间。

595
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:08,500
When or before, you know, or execution time. Right. And
在执行之前或之时，你知道的，或者执行时间。对的。而且

596
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:18,980
well, it's compile time, link time and execution time. But link or load time. So compile time,
好的，有编译时间、链接时间和执行时间。但是链接或加载时间。所以编译时间，

597
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:27,060
you know, it's very hard. We are not going to talk much about it. The link and load time,
你知道的，这很困难。我们不打算多谈。链接和加载时间，

598
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:32,740
we are going to talk briefly and then we are going to focus mostly on the translation
我们将会简要地交谈，然后我们将主要关注翻译部分。

599
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:44,980
happen and execution time. So before talking about link load time translation, let's remind
发生和执行时间。因此，在谈论链接加载时间翻译之前，让我们先提醒一下。

600
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:56,420
ourselves what is the lifetime of a program. You start with a source. You compile, you get the
我们自己来谈一谈一个程序的生命周期。你从源代码开始。你编译，然后你得到了什么？

601
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:06,420
object modules and then you link with possible other modules and libraries and then you load it
对象模块，然后你与可能的其他模块和库进行链接，然后加载它。

602
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:14,420
in the memory. And in the process, you are going also to link with some system libraries
在内存中。在这个过程中，你还将链接一些系统库。

603
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:17,140
and some libraries you can actually link them.
还有一些库，你实际上可以将它们链接起来。

604
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,160
at the runtime after you started executing.
在你开始执行之后的运行时。

605
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,360
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you need to be translated.

606
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,780
But here is our previous example.
但是这里是我们之前的例子。

607
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,840
Actually what implicitly we've done,
实际上，我们暗示地做了什么，

608
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:34,600
you modify the addresses before loading to memory.
在加载到内存之前，你修改地址。

609
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:38,680
So this is linked load time when you modify the others.
这是在修改其他内容时链接的加载时间。

610
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:43,280
Right? Remember here, we said this is our program, right?
对吗？记住，我们说过这是我们的计划，对吗？

611
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,360
And maybe this is on the disk,
也许这个在磁盘上。

612
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:52,320
but when I am cooperating system is going to load
但是当我合作时，系统将会加载。

613
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,140
this program in memory,

615
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:03,520
so that it's not going to overlap with other programs

616
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,560
which are already in the physical memory.
这些已经在物理内存中了。

617
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:13,680
So this is what happens. Okay.
这就是发生的事情。好的。

618
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,520
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

619
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,880
So,

620
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:23,540
make sense? It's any questions?

623
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,100
for personal computers were very simple.
个人电脑的操作非常简单。

624
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:47,880
You have only one address space

627
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,480
the entire physical address space.
整个物理地址空间。

628
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:06,000
You have the illusion of a dedicated machine

629
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,400
because you have a dedicated machine.
因为你有一台专用的机器。

630
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,240
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

631
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:14,840
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you need to be translated.

632
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:18,520
So how do you do this?
那么你是如何做到这一点的呢？

633
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,720
Now is the next step.
现在是下一步。

634
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:24,920
If you start to work to run multiple programs,
如果你开始工作来运行多个程序，

635
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,200
you want to run in the same computer.

636
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,000
It's again, if the operating system

637
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,920
doesn't provide you support,
不提供你支持，

638
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,240
like we'll see for translation,

640
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:44,600
is basically translation.
基本上是翻译。

641
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,660
You translate the addresses of the program
你翻译程序的地址

642
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:52,520
before you load it to avoid overlapping,
在加载之前，请避免重叠。

643
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,780
conflicting with another program.

644
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:58,880
And this was the case for early version

646
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:06,140
I mean, the early version of the Windows.
我的意思是，Windows的早期版本。

647
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:10,900
With these things, it's risky.

648
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:14,400
There is no protection to the buggy code.
代码中没有保护措施。

649
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,720
And all applications here have access to the entire memory.

650
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,420
So one application can read and write
所以一个应用程序可以读取和写入数据。

651
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,300
the data from another application.
来自另一个应用的数据。

652
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,840
So it can also crash another application.
所以它也可以使另一个应用程序崩溃。

653
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:35,520
The next level is to provide protection.
下一个级别是提供保护。

655
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,560
steal the applications are going to be,

Okay, so you protect and isolate programs,
好的，所以你保护和隔离程序，

680
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:11,040
but it requires you to again override the addresses

712
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:02,300
about the general address translation, okay?

713
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:08,760
And the general address translation is happening this way.
通用地址转换是这样进行的。

714
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,400
You have the CPU, remember this,
你有中央处理器，记住这一点，

715
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,080
because sometimes it's least to confusion.
因为有时候最好避免混淆。

716
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:20,480
When the CPU issues an instruction, in general,
当CPU发出一条指令时，一般来说，

717
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,460
the instructions contain virtual addresses.
这些指令包含虚拟地址。

718
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:27,880
So these virtual addresses are then mapped
所以这些虚拟地址然后被映射

719
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,100
to the physical address.
到实际地址。

720
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,420
And they are done typically by chip
它们通常是由芯片完成的。

721
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:35,880
or a part of the processor,
或者是处理器的一部分，

722
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:40,280
which is called MMU, memory management unit.
它被称为MMU，即内存管理单元。

723
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:46,560
So the programs, because they are running on the CPU,
所以这些程序，因为它们在CPU上运行，

724
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,740
they see virtual address spaces.
他们看到虚拟地址空间。

725
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:52,580
Okay?

From the memory side, you have only physical addresses.
从内存的角度来看，你只有物理地址。

727
01:06:55,420 --> 01:07:03,120
So,

728
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:11,780
you know, in translation, it's a generalized technique,

729
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:13,760
which helps you with many things.

730
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,740
But if you really want,
但是如果你真的想要的话，

731
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:21,680
but if you only want, like I mentioned, protections,

732
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,800
control overlap and things like that.
控制重叠和类似的事情。

733
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:29,160
But if you really want to implement only one of these things
但是如果你真的只想实施其中一件事情

734
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,460
like protection, like we've seen in the past,
像保护一样，就像我们过去所见到的那样，

735
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:34,100
things are easier.
事情变得更容易了。

736
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:39,460
And why you want protection?
为什么你想要保护？

737
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:43,220
Because if task A cannot gain access to task B data,
因为如果任务A无法访问任务B的数据，

738
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:46,380
no way for A to adversely affect you.
A无法对你产生负面影响。

739
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:51,380
Now, if you have the translation,
现在，如果你有翻译的话，

740
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:58,660
then every program can be linked or loaded
那么每个程序都可以被链接或加载。

741
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:01,140
into the same region of the user space.

742
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:02,140
Right?
对吗？

743
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:05,400
So you have, again, you have two application in this case.
所以在这种情况下，你有两个应用程序。

744
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:10,880
Both applications have different virtual addresses,

745
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,700
virtual address space,
虚拟地址空间

746
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:17,260
because they have their own process.
因为他们有自己的流程。

747
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:21,040
And each process has its own address space,
并且每个进程都有自己的地址空间。

748
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,240
virtual address space.
虚拟地址空间。

749
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:26,860
These both applications,

751
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:33,260
Both of them, they see virtual memory,

752
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,320
say from zero, zero, zero to FFF.
从零到FFF。

753
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:41,700
The trick here is that these two address spaces
这里的关键是这两个地址空间

754
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:46,300
are going to be mapped to different location
将被映射到不同的位置。

755
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,660
in the physical memory by using translation.
通过使用翻译将数据存储在物理内存中。

756
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:52,900
That's what the translation gives you.
这就是翻译给你的结果。

757
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:56,760
Let's consider examples.
让我们来考虑一些例子。

758
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,500
Okay?
好的。

759
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,340
So it's one way to do it.
这是一种方法。

760
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:06,340
It's a very simple change of the previous
这是对之前的一个非常简单的改变。

761
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:11,340
Bayesian bound technique.
贝叶斯界限技术。

762
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:21,240
And here is a difference.
这里有一个区别。

763
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,260
Let me just go back to make sure that it's different, right?
让我回去确认一下，是不是不同的，对吗？

764
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,220
This is a difference.
这是一个不同之处。

765
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:30,220
In this case, the Bayesian bound, right?
在这种情况下，是贝叶斯界限，对吗？

766
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:32,500
Are absolute addresses.
是绝对地址。

767
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,380
And the program address is also absolute address.
并且程序地址也是绝对地址。

768
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,320
You have one, zero, one, zero.
你有一个，零，一个，零。

769
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:41,960
And absolute meaning I am referring to physical addresses.
我指的是绝对意义上的物理地址。

770
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,500
So you need to compare one, zero, one, zero
所以你需要比较1、0、1、0。

771
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,300
with the base and with the bound.
以基础和约束。

772
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:55,740
With translation, the program address is not absolute.
翻译时，程序地址不是绝对的。

773
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:59,580
It's relative to the bound, to the base address.
这与边界和基地址有关。

774
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:03,180
So actually the real address, physical address,
所以实际上，真正的地址，物理地址，

775
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:07,240
is a program address plus the base.
是一个程序地址加上基址。

776
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:10,380
Okay?
好的。

777
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,820
So in this case, the program address is zero, zero, one, zero
所以在这种情况下，程序地址是零、零、一、零。

778
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:17,980
and base address is one, zero, zero, zero.
基地址是1, 0, 0, 0。

779
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:20,580
So if you add them up, it's one, zero, one, zero.
所以如果你把它们加起来，就是一、零、一、零。

780
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:26,260
And these addresses are translated on the fly.
这些地址是即时翻译的。

781
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:27,480
Right? Very convenient.
对吗？非常方便。

782
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:34,460
So you see now, these program addresses,
所以你现在看到了，这些程序地址，

783
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,100
they don't need to be changed.
它们不需要被改变。

784
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,740
The only thing I need to change in order to make sure
我只需要改变一件事，以确保

785
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:42,360
that programs are mapped into different address spaces,
这些程序被映射到不同的地址空间中，

786
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:45,660
physical address spaces,
物理地址空间

787
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:47,500
is to just change the base address.
只需要更改基地址。

788
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,720
Right?
对吗？

789
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:50,560
Indeed.
确实。

790
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:55,280
This is, it's harder for location.
这是，对于位置来说更难一些。

791
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,700
It's also called then basically, you know,
它基本上也被称为那个，你知道的。

792
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:00,540
a question here.
这里有一个问题。

793
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:01,940
Can you touch the program?
你能触摸这个程序吗？

794
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,300
Can you touch the OS?
你能触摸操作系统吗？

795
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:14,540
But if you are careful, we are not going,
但是如果你小心的话，我们就不会去了。

796
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:18,660
you cannot touch the OS because the OS will be outside
你无法触碰操作系统，因为操作系统将位于外部。

797
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:23,660
the base address and the bound address of any user process.
任何用户进程的基地址和边界地址。

798
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:28,080
Can you touch other programs?
你能触及其他程序吗？

799
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,220
No, if you are careful.
不，只要你小心就可以。

800
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:30,940
That's how you provide protection.
这就是你提供保护的方式。

801
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:34,620
But it's, again, it's a very simple idea.
但是，再次强调，这是一个非常简单的想法。

802
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:37,240
Okay. Any questions about that?
好的。对此有任何问题吗？

803
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:41,180
Do you see how now I no longer need to override
你看到了吗，现在我不再需要覆盖了。

804
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:44,420
the program addresses when I load the program in memory?
程序在加载到内存时，会解决什么问题？

805
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:48,620
I just do that as a runtime when the program executes.
我只是在程序执行时作为运行时执行这个操作。

806
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:52,820
Any questions?
有任何问题吗？

807
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:57,500
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

808
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:03,960
So what are the issues with this Bayesian bound method?
这个贝叶斯边界方法有哪些问题？

809
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:08,380
The issue here is about what is called,
这里的问题是关于所谓的，

810
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:10,460
it's about fragmentation.
这是关于碎片化的问题。

811
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:13,940
And this is a very simple example
这是一个非常简单的例子。

812
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:19,860
because each process requires different amount of data,
因为每个过程需要不同数量的数据，

813
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:23,700
the different amount of space, memory space.
不同的空间量，内存空间。

814
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:26,180
So they are not uniform.
所以它们不是统一的。

815
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,460
Okay. And because they are not uniform,
好的。因为它们不统一，

816
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:32,740
like in this case, process two requires a lot
像在这种情况下，步骤二需要很多。

817
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:38,160
and you process two goes away.
你处理两个离开。

818
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,220
And as the process nine comes,
随着第九个步骤的进行，

819
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:44,020
you allocate memory space of process nine,
你为进程九分配内存空间。

820
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:46,580
process five goes away.
第五个过程结束了。

821
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:49,400
And now look at this situation.
现在看看这个情况。

822
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,780
You have process 11 and you have enough physical memory
你有11个进程，并且你有足够的物理内存。

823
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:53,620
for process 11.
处理进程11。

824
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:58,660
But the point that this physical memory is scattered
但是这个物理内存是分散的这一点

825
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:03,460
and process 11 needs a contiguous region of memory.
并且进程11需要一个连续的内存区域。

826
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:06,740
Okay. So that's a problem.
好的。那就是一个问题。

827
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:09,020
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you need to be translated.

828
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:13,340
So how do you do it?

And there are many solutions,
而且有很多解决方案，

831
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:21,700
but one simple solution is to have,
但是一个简单的解决方案是拥有，

832
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:26,700
instead of only one segment for each program,
每个节目只有一个片段，而不是只有一个片段。

833
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:30,200
you can have different segments.
你可以有不同的分段。

834
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:34,420
And typically you can have code segment, data segment,
而通常你可以有代码段、数据段、

835
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:37,120
stack segment, heap segment, right?
堆段、栈段，对吗？

836
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,060
And you do this independently
我独立完成这个任务。

837
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:43,100
and this gives you a little bit more flexibility.
这样可以给你更多的灵活性。

838
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:43,940
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

839
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:46,280
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you would like to be translated.

840
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:52,140
So also another problem is a solution I showed you here.
所以另一个问题也是我在这里给你展示的解决方案。

841
01:13:52,140 --> 01:14:00,060
The original solution, the Bayesian bound,
原始解决方案，贝叶斯界限，

842
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:05,060
is that remember about threads and processes.
这是关于线程和进程的记忆。

843
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:09,300
You can have multiple threads in the same process
你可以在同一个进程中拥有多个线程。

844
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:13,160
and the thread in the same process shares a code.

845
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,540
But how you are going to do it here?
但是你在这里要如何做呢？

846
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,380
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

847
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:23,660
Because, right?
因为，对吗？

848
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:30,460
And even like think about actually,
而且，甚至可以考虑实际上，

849
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:33,300
you can think about maybe a better example
你可以考虑一下，也许有一个更好的例子。

850
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,020
than what I said is libraries.
你说的是图书馆。

851
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:39,520
If you have common libraries, system libraries,
如果你有常用的库、系统库，

852
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,480
and with these libraries,
和这些库一起，

853
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,820
they are used by multiple applications.
它们被多个应用程序使用。

854
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:49,780
So it makes no sense to load a copy of the library
所以加载库的副本没有意义。

855
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:51,780
for each application.
对于每个申请。

856
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:53,940
These are, again, shared system libraries.
这些是共享系统库。

857
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:55,820
Right?
对吗？

858
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:57,860
How you do that?
你是如何做到的？

859
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,900
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you would like to be translated.

860
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:06,500
So again, now we can alleviate this problem.
所以，现在我们可以缓解这个问题了。

861
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,260
Like I mentioned that instead of having
我之前提到，与其拥有...，不如...

862
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:13,420
one segment per process, you have multiple segments.
每个进程一个段，你有多个段。

863
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:14,260
Right?
对吗？

864
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,820
Per process.
每个进程。

865
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,340
A typical one, like I mentioned,
一个典型的例子，就像我之前提到的，

866
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:21,660
you have code, data, stack, heap segment,
你有代码、数据、栈、堆段。

867
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:24,340
but in general, you can have a segment at one extreme,
但总的来说，你可以在一个极端拥有一个片段。

868
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:26,340
you can have a segment for each function.
你可以为每个功能创建一个段落。

869
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:29,020
Right?
对吗？

870
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:33,920
And for each segment, you have a base and a bound or a limit.
对于每个片段，你都有一个基准和一个上限或限制。

871
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,180
And now, because the segments are smaller,
现在，由于片段更小，

872
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:39,540
you have more flexibility how to place them
你有更多的灵活性来安排它们的位置。

873
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:43,060
in the physical memory.
在物理内存中。

874
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:45,160
Let me go back here.
让我回去这里。

875
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,540
Is this process 11?
这个过程是11吗？

876
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:52,540
If this process 11, maybe it had been consistent
如果这个过程是11的话，可能它一直是一致的。

877
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:58,420
from two segments, then you could have fit
从两个片段中，你可以拼凑出来。

878
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:00,340
process one in physical memory,
在物理内存中处理第一个。

879
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:03,500
because maybe one segment of process one
因为可能是流程的一个部分

880
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:06,220
would have fit in one of these gaps
会适合其中一个空隙中

881
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:08,080
and the other one is the other gap.
另一个是另一个间隙。

882
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,460
Okay?
好的。

883
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:12,900
So that's why how multiple segments can help.
这就是为什么多个细分市场可以起到帮助的原因。

884
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:13,740
Okay?
好的？

885
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:22,540
And this is one version.
这是其中一个版本。

886
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,060
You have then a map.
你有一张地图。

887
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:27,100
How would you implement it?
你会如何实施它？

888
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:30,940
Now you need a map, a segment map,
现在你需要一张地图，一张分段地图，

889
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:34,620
which needs to reside in the processor.
需要驻留在处理器中。

890
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:37,340
And then how do you address it?
然后你如何处理它呢？

891
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:41,260
How do we know which segment we are in?
我们如何知道我们处于哪个片段？

892
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:46,740
So one way to do it is to divide the address space,
所以一种方法是将地址空间划分为

893
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:49,620
the virtual address, into two.
虚拟地址，分为两部分。

894
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:54,620
The first bits of the address,
地址的前几位是什么？

895
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:59,180
or the most significant ones, represent the segment.
或者最重要的那些代表这个部分。

896
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:02,900
Going to the segment map.
前往分段地图。

897
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:08,660
And the second, and the other part of the address
和第二个，以及地址的另一部分。

898
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:09,860
is called the offset.
被称为偏移量。

899
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:14,860
So when the processor issues such virtual address,
当处理器发出这样的虚拟地址时，

900
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:23,340
the processor takes the first, the segment bits,
处理器获取第一个，段位。

901
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:27,040
its indexes in the segment map,
它在段映射中的索引，

902
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,060
then it gets the base and the limit.
然后它获取基准和限制。

903
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,340
Okay?
好的。

904
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:36,160
The offset is added to the base.
偏移量被加到基数上。

905
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,780
And now this, you have the physical address,
现在，你有了实际地址，

906
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:45,460
and then you need also to compare the offset to the limit.
然后你还需要将偏移量与限制值进行比较。

907
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:50,780
Right? To see that you are within the segment.
对吗？看到你在这个范围内。

908
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:53,500
If not, it's an error.
如果不是的话，那就是一个错误。

909
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,520
And you are done.
你已经完成了。

910
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:00,380
Okay?
好的？

911
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:05,440
So now you can chunk the memory in as many chunks
所以现在你可以将内存分成许多块。

912
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:09,500
as you have in this map table.
正如您在这张地图表中所看到的。

913
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:17,800
And this is what very early versions

914
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:21,800
of Intel 86 implemented.

915
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:29,600
80, you know, 86.
80, 你知道的，86。

916
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,800
Okay?
好的。

917
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,560
So we are going to stop here.
