761
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,080
f a period for all tasks.
为所有任务设置一个时间段。

762
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,480
And if that is less than one,
而如果那个数小于一，

763
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,000
you, the EDF is feasible.
你好，EDF是可行的。

764
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,160
It's working.
它正在工作。

765
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,920
In our case, it's one over four,
在我们的情况下，它是四分之一。

766
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,320
plus two over five, plus two over seven,
加上五分之二，再加上七分之二，

767
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,160
is less than one.
小于一。

768
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,840
So it's feasible.
是的，这是可行的。

769
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:34,400
Like we've seen at least from our simulation
就像我们至少从我们的模拟中所看到的一样。

770
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,920
for the first, you know, whatever, 20 seconds.
首先，你知道的，无论是什么，前20秒。

771
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,280
Okay?
好的。

772
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,600
And this is very cool because you see,
而且这非常酷，因为你看到，

773
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,440
this is also optimal from the point of view of utilization
这也是从利用率的角度来看最优的。

774
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,720
because C over D for a task is how much
因为C相对于D在完成任务上的价值有多大。

775
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,440
is going to utilize from the CPU.
将要利用CPU。

776
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,760
If I want to utilize, I have like the first task,
如果我想利用，我有第一个任务。

777
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,040
one time unit, one second out of four seconds,
一个时间单位，即四秒钟中的一秒，

778
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,600
the utilization, that task alone is going to get
利用率，仅仅这个任务就会得到。

779
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,400
one over four of the CPU, 25% of the CPU.
CPU的四分之一，即CPU的25%。

780
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:12,120
So the sum of these C over Ds cannot be greater than one.
所以这些C除以D的总和不能大于一。

781
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,200
Right?
对吗？

782
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,760
Because you cannot use more CPUs than you have.
因为你不能使用超过你拥有的CPU数量。

783
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,600
This is a very good,
这是非常好的。

784
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,680
that's why you are talking about server
这就是为什么你在谈论服务器。

785
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:21,520
because it's very good.
因为它非常好。

786
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,480
It's also optimal.
这也是最佳选择。

787
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,640
Okay?
好的。

788
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:30,720
Now, things are more complicated
现在，事情变得更加复杂了。

789
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,560
and we touch a little bit about starvation
我们稍微谈到了饥饿问题。

790
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,960
and we are going to talk more during this lecture
我们将在这次讲座中进行更多的交流。

791
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,160
and the next lecture.
下一堂讲座。

792
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,160
And one thing to make sure is that starvation
而且要确保的一件事是饥饿

793
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,840
is different from deadlock.
不同于死锁。

794
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:53,200
Starvation means that you are starved,
饥饿意味着你被饿着。

795
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,040
but, you know, eventually you are not,
但是，你知道，最终你并不是这样的，

796
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,600
you can still run.
你仍然可以跑。

797
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,320
Like we are talking in the previous case,
就像我们在之前的案例中所讨论的那样，

798
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,720
you are starved and you can restart forever
你饿了，而且你可以无限重启。

799
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,440
if there are police priority scheduling,
如果有警察优先调度，

800
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,560
if there are always lower priorities,
如果总是有更低的优先级，

801
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,520
tasks or jobs in the system.
系统中的任务或工作。

802
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,520
But once that they are no longer, you are scared.
但是一旦他们不在了，你就害怕了。

803
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:22,640
Deadlock is a different in the sense that
死锁在某种意义上是不同的。

804
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,120
you get to a point that you cannot resolve that
你已经到了一个无法解决的地步。

805
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,000
no matter what happens in the system,
无论系统发生什么事情，

806
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,680
unless you kill the process or you start the system.
除非你终止该进程或者重新启动系统。

807
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,640
Right?
对吗？

808
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,920
We'll talk more about that next time,
我们下次再详细讨论这个话题，

809
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,960
but we're also going to touch a little bit
但是我们也会稍微涉及一点

810
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,440
during this lecture.
在这个讲座期间。

811
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,600
Right?
对吗？

812
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,480
And you have this causes of starvation,
你有关于饥饿原因的资料吗？

813
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,920
scheduling policy, like we said,
调度策略，就像我们所说的那样，

814
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,080
never runs a particular thread on the CPU and so forth.
从不在CPU上运行特定线程等等。

815
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:54,720
But we'll explore more about these problems.
但是我们将进一步探讨这些问题。

816
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:02,720
One way to avoid starvation is not one way.
避免饥饿的方法不止一种。

817
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:10,080
It's obviously one way to alleviate starvation
这显然是缓解饥饿的一种方法。

818
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:19,580
if the CPU is always used, if there is work to do.
如果CPU一直被使用，只要有工作要做。

819
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:23,740
If you have a scheduler who doesn't use a CPU
如果你有一个调度器不使用CPU的话

820
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:27,260
and keeps a CPU idle, obviously it's much higher chance
并且保持CPU空闲，显然机会更高。

821
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,580
that you are going to stop some threats.
你打算停止一些威胁。

822
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:33,900
The schedulers which are always using CPU,
调度器总是在使用CPU，

823
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:38,660
they don't leave the CPU idle while there is work to do,
他们在有任务需要完成时不会让CPU处于空闲状态，

824
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:42,460
while there are ready processes in the system,
当系统中存在可用的进程时，

825
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:47,260
or ready threats, they are called work conserving.
或者准备好的威胁，它们被称为工作保持的。

826
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:49,820
The schedulers which are not work conserving
非工作保守的调度器

827
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,200
are schedulers which are--
日程安排器是什么？

828
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:56,860
they may maintain the CPU idle even
他们可能会保持CPU处于空闲状态。

829
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,700
if there are processes in the system which
如果系统中存在进程，则

830
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,100
can already be executed.
可以立即执行。

831
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:05,540
And obviously, like I said, they can leave the--
而且，正如我所说的，他们可以离开--

832
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:09,060
trivially lead to starvation.
微不足道地导致饥饿。

833
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,420
In this class, we assume that the schedulers
在这门课上，我们假设调度程序

834
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:12,860
work conserving.
工作保持。

835
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,420
So we don't need to worry about work conserving,
所以我们不需要担心工作保留。

836
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,100
but just to keep--
但只是为了保持--

837
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,820
for completeness, let you know that there are such schedulers.
为了完整起见，让你知道有这样的调度器存在。

838
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:30,260
So here is another thing--
所以这里还有一件事——

839
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,020
there's another example of schedulers,
还有一个调度器的例子，

840
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,300
a few examples of schedulers which leads to starvation.
一些导致饥饿的调度器的例子。

841
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,940
Again, you already know about some of them.
再说一遍，你已经对其中一些了解。

842
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,340
Here is a new one.
这是一个新的。

843
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,660
It's LIFO, last in, first out.
这是LIFO，即后进先出。

844
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:45,060
So it's as opposed to first in, first out, or first come,
所以与先进先出或先来先服务相反，

845
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,100
first serve.
首先服务。

846
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:52,500
This is going to serve the tasks which are inserted,
这将为插入的任务提供服务。

847
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:57,340
which arrived the latest first.
哪个最后到达的先到达。

848
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:02,740
And this can be very unfair and obviously can cause starvation
而且这可能非常不公平，显然会导致饥饿。

849
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:05,860
because you can have new tasks always arriving.
因为你可以随时有新的任务到来。

850
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:08,300
You are only going to schedule those.
你只需要安排那些。

851
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:16,820
And when arrival rate exceeds how much
当到达率超过多少时

852
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,100
the number of tasks which you get,
你得到的任务数量是多少？

853
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,100
it's more than what you can process, obviously,
这超出了你能处理的范围，显然。

854
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:24,460
you are going to starve the whole tasks for that purpose.
你将为了那个目的而让整个任务挨饿。

855
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:30,980
FIFO doesn't really have that problem.
FIFO并没有真正遇到这个问题。

856
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:36,220
But anyway, this is just about what about first come,
不管怎样

857
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,740
first serve.
先到先得。

858
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:41,940
FIFO or first come, first serve is the same thing.
FIFO或先来先服务是同一回事。

859
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:45,900
They don't have as much of a problem
他们没有那么大的问题。

860
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,380
because eventually you are going to drain the cure.
因为最终你会耗尽治愈的方法。

861
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:52,300
Let me see.
让我看看。

862
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,220
It's a question.
这是一个问题。

863
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:57,460
Why would you ever want a non-overconserving scheduler?
为什么你会想要一个非过度保守的调度器呢？

864
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:02,460
That's a good question.
这是一个很好的问题。

865
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:06,940
Why always you would like to?
为什么你总是喜欢这样做呢？

866
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:14,260
So there are schedulers which you
所以有调度器，它们可以帮助你

867
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:17,740
want to be predictable, very predictable.
希望能够变得可预测，非常可预测。

868
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:20,900
There are schedulers you want certain things to happen
有一些调度程序，你希望某些事情发生。

869
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,420
exactly at the right time.
正好在合适的时间。

870
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,100
So you want, for instance, to produce
所以你想要，例如，生产什么？

871
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:29,860
a result every 100 milliseconds.
每100毫秒一个结果。

872
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:35,100
So in that particular case, even if you
在那种特殊情况下，即使你...

873
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:38,100
can process more and earlier, you
可以更早更多地处理，你

874
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,500
are not going to process because you are going
因为你要去，所以不会进行处理。

875
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,020
to produce a result there.
在那里产生一个结果。

876
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,780
So that's kind of one example.
这就是一个例子。

877
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:51,740
When you want to--
当你想要--

878
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:54,140
regularly, this is also in networking.
经常，这也是在网络中。

879
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,180
In networking, you want to send one packet every--
在网络中，你想要每隔一段时间发送一个数据包--

880
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:02,060
say you have one packet you are going
说你有一个包裹，你要去。

881
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:07,140
to send every one microsecond.
每发送一次，间隔为一微秒。

882
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:10,340
Now, you may ask, why do you want to do that?
现在，你可能会问，为什么你想这么做呢？

883
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:11,340
Why?
为什么？

884
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,220
And in general, one reason you may
而且一般来说，你可能有一个原因

885
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:16,940
want to do this to keep this kind of space
想要做这个来保持这种空间。

886
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:20,540
because you don't want to overwhelm the next stage
因为你不想让下一阶段变得过于压抑

887
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,540
or the next processing stage.
或者下一个处理阶段。

888
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,260
Like, for instance, in networking,
比如，在网络领域中，

889
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:28,780
if you send bursts of packets instead of spacing them,
如果您发送数据包的突发而不是间隔发送，

890
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:31,540
then you have a higher probability
那么你有更高的概率

891
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:34,940
you are going to go into overflow
你将要溢出了。

892
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:40,260
to send more packets than a downstream router can handle.
发送比下游路由器处理能力更多的数据包。

893
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,700
And then packets will be lost.
然后数据包将会丢失。

894
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:45,140
So that's an example.
这是一个例子。

895
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,500
OK?
好的。

896
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:57,060
So it's again, the first comfort served,
所以，又是第一次享受舒适，

897
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,740
the only problem you have is that you
你唯一的问题是你

898
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,300
are going to have a very long job.
你们将要做一份非常长的工作。

899
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,780
You never yield.
你从不让步。

900
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:05,020
And then you have to start for some hours, a while.
然后你必须开始工作几个小时，一段时间。

901
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:09,300
But it's again, as long as over some time intervals,
但只要在一些时间间隔内，

902
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,540
the load offered to the system that the system has to process
系统需要处理的负载

903
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:16,260
is lower than the capacity of the system,
低于系统的容量。

904
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:17,900
everyone is going to run.
大家都要跑起来。

905
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:25,260
Is round-robin prone to starvation?
轮转调度算法容易出现饥饿现象吗？

906
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:34,740
Well, if you have n processes and if you have a time quanta
好的，如果你有n个进程，并且有一个时间片。

907
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:42,900
then of q, then your turn will come every n minus 1 times
然后轮到q，然后你的回合将每n减1次到来。

908
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,700
q milliseconds to run again.
再次运行需要q毫秒。

909
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:49,980
So you don't have starvation.
所以你们没有饥荒。

910
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:55,780
Now, is priority scheduling prone to starvation?
现在，优先级调度是否容易出现饥饿现象？

911
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,580
Of course it is.
当然是的。

912
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:58,900
We just discussed about that, right?
我们刚刚讨论过那个，对吗？

913
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:02,540
Again, priority scheduling runs every job.
再次强调，优先级调度会运行每个作业。

914
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:06,180
Every-- first it has to finish all the jobs
每一件事情——首先它必须完成所有的工作。

915
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:09,900
at the high priority level before going to the next step.
在进行下一步之前，以高优先级处理。

916
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,740
OK?
好的。

917
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:20,580
And now, as-- what is our-- it's like,
现在，作为我们的--它就像是，

918
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:24,940
as a preview for the next lecture for the deadlocks,
作为下一堂关于死锁的预告，

919
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:28,660
let me give you one example about a deadlock.
让我给你举一个死锁的例子。

920
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,940
We alluded about this deadlock last lecture
我们在上一堂课中提到了这个僵局。

921
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:34,340
when we talk about priority inversion.
当我们谈论优先级反转时。

922
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:37,260
And this is what can happen.
这就是可能发生的情况。

923
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:37,780
OK?
好的。

924
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:46,180
So, but again, deadlock means you are stuck.
所以，但是再说一遍，死锁意味着你被困住了。

925
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:46,940
Can't do anything.
什么都做不了。

926
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:52,100
Even if you have no other job in the system,
即使你在系统中没有其他工作，

927
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:54,700
you are still stuck, you cannot make progress.
你还是卡住了，无法取得进展。

928
01:05:54,700 --> 01:06:00,700
So say a job at priority 1, lower priority, acquire a lock.
所以说，优先级为1的工作，较低优先级，需要获取一个锁。

929
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,940
OK?
好的。

930
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:08,140
And now the job 1 is in critical section.
现在工作1处于关键阶段。

931
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:12,700
But now job 3 comes, it's a higher priority.
但是现在工作3来了，它是更重要的任务。

932
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:17,100
And job 3 tries to acquire the lock held by job 1.
而作业3试图获取作业1持有的锁。

933
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:21,820
Right?
对吗？

934
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:22,340
OK?
好的。

935
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:29,860
But you cannot, you are block on acquiring.
但是你不能，你被阻止了获取。

936
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,100
Right?
对吗？

937
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:37,740
And by the way, so now job 3 waits for job 1
顺便说一下，现在工作3正在等待工作1。

938
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,260
to finish to release a lock.
完成释放锁定。

939
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:42,980
And job 1 is not executed because job 3
而工作1没有被执行是因为工作3。

940
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:44,820
has a higher priority.
优先级较高。

941
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:46,940
That's kind of deadlock.
这有点僵局。

942
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,180
Right?
对吗？

943
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:51,660
And this is priority inversion.
这就是优先级反转。

944
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:52,140
Right?
对吗？

945
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:57,980
Because you are waiting for a job with a lower priority
因为你正在等待一个优先级较低的工作。

946
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,220
to release a lock.
解锁。

947
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,060
And you cannot release a lock because of you.
你不能释放锁，是因为你的原因。

948
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:11,500
And this is the definition of priority inversion.
这是优先级反转的定义。

949
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,020
OK?
好的。

950
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:15,180
This is another example with a live lock.
这是另一个出现活锁的例子。

951
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:19,260
You have lock acquires, lock release, the low priority,
你有锁获取、锁释放和低优先级。

952
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:23,940
and the high priority is again try to achieve, fly block.
并且高优先级是再次尝试实现，飞行阻塞。

953
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:25,620
Always busy waiting.
一直忙着等待。

954
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:31,020
So what are the solutions?
那么有哪些解决方案呢？

955
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:35,700
One solution is priority donation or inheritance.
一种解决方案是优先捐赠或继承。

956
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:39,140
So in this particular case, if job 1, which is lower priority,
那么在这种特殊情况下，如果工作1，即较低优先级的工作，

957
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:42,900
holds a lock and job 3 wants to acquire it,
持有一个锁，而作业3想要获取它。

958
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,740
what happens in this case?
这种情况下会发生什么？

959
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:48,540
Job 3 donates its priority to job 1.
工作3将其优先级捐赠给工作1。

960
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:51,100
So job 1, while it is a critical section
所以工作1，虽然它是一个关键部分。

961
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,540
and while holding the lock, now is
并且在握住锁的同时

962
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:57,460
going to be promoted to priority 3, the highest priority.
将要晋升为优先级3，最高优先级。

963
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:00,580
So now you get time to run and to finish.
所以现在你有时间跑步和完成任务。

964
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:04,900
And after it releases, it goes back, job 1 on priority 1,
然后在发布之后，它回到了第一优先级的工作1。

965
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,940
lower priority on its previous priority,
将其之前的优先级降低

966
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:10,340
and job 3 can acquire the lock.
并且工作3可以获取锁。

967
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:14,020
And this is you are going to have in project 2.
这是你在项目2中将要拥有的。

968
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:14,500
OK.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

969
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:17,540
So here is an example.
这里有一个例子。

972
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:26,260
And I have here for the fun, which is not

973
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,580
necessarily related to the lecture.

974
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:31,500
This is in '97 or so many years ago.
这是在'97年左右，大约很多年前。

975
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:37,020
But it was a big event because it was the first one

980
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:56,100
It was this kind of different delivery mechanism.

981
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,380
Let me just see whether I have this one.
让我看看我是否明白了这个。

982
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:13,580
So I'm just-- OK.
所以我只是--好的。

983
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:14,700
Do you see my screen?
你能看到我的屏幕吗？

984
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,660
You don't see my screen.

985
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:18,580
OK.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like to have translated.

Let me just-- I'm not sure how much you see it.
让我看看——我不确定你能看到多少。

987
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:28,060
And for some reason, I cannot let me see if I can do it.
而且出于某种原因，我不能让自己看看我是否能做到。

988
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:28,540
Yeah.
是的。

989
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:32,460
Let's do this for now.
让我们暂时这样做吧

990

999
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:28,460
But this is the one we are talking about.
但这就是我们正在谈论的那个。

1000
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:37,660
And now the problem is that a few days into the mission,

1001
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:40,740
multiple systems resets occurred.
发生了多次系统重置。

1002
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:46,220
And it was for the software.

losing valuable time and making progress.
浪费宝贵的时间并且没有取得进展。

1005
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:56,940
And what it turned out to be was priority inversion.

1006
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:59,460
It was this priority two, highest priority,

01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:09,860
another task, which was collecting samples,

01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:16,180
collecting data, which was lower priority, was getting the lock.
收集数据，这是较低优先级的任务，正在被锁定。

1012
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:21,540
So now the priority--
所以现在的优先事项是什么？

1013
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:24,380
the collector had the lock.
收藏家拥有这把锁。

1015
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,620
Now what happens typically in these systems,

1016
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:34,380
you have a watchdog.
你有一只看门狗。

并且看门狗是一个进程，它

1018
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:42,580
looks whether there is forward progress.
看看是否有前进的进展。

1019
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:44,300
And if there is no forward progress,

1021
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:49,020
is going to reboot the system.
将要重新启动系统。

1022
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:56,900
And it turns out that there was actually
原来事实上是这样的

1023
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:01,100
code for the priority donation to avoid this problem,
为了避免这个问题，我们需要编写优先捐赠的代码。

1024
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,820
priority inversion.
优先级反转。

1025
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:12,620
But it was turned off because the developers thought
但是它被关闭了，因为开发者们认为

1026
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,940
they were worried about the performance.
他们对表现感到担忧。

1027
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:18,020
Of course, in this case, the fix was
当然，在这种情况下，修复的方法是

1028
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:21,740
to upload and fix back the code.
上传并修复代码

1029
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:24,860
So again, what we are talking here is not only theoretical.
所以，我们在这里讨论的不仅仅是理论性的。

1030
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:25,500
It happens.
没关系。

1031
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:30,100
Let's look about others.
让我们关注其他人。

1032
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,540
Is shortest time first and multi-level feedback
最短时间优先和多级反馈。

1033
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:37,380
cube prone to starvation?
魔方容易饥饿吗？

1034
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:39,340
They are, right?
他们是的，对吗？

1035
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:42,260
Like we discussed, shortest time first,
像我们讨论过的那样，最短时间优先。

1036
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:45,100
the long job can be starved in the favor of short ones.
长期的工作可能会因为短期的工作而被忽视。

1037
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:48,260
If you have always short jobs arriving,
如果你一直有短期工作到来，

1038
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:51,580
they are going to starve the long jobs.
他们打算裁员。

1039
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:58,100
With multi-level feedback cube, it's
使用多级反馈队列，它可以

1040
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:01,540
an approximation of short remaining time first.
首先，给出一个短时间的近似剩余时间。

1041
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:03,020
So it suffers from the same problem.
所以它遭受着同样的问题。

1042
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:08,340
And again, in some sense, the case,
而且，从某种意义上说，这个案例，

1043
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:10,540
the cause for starvation, it's always a priority.
饥饿的原因，始终是一个优先考虑的问题。

1044
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:13,020
Whether it's a fixed priority or whether it's
无论是固定优先级还是

1045
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:16,620
implicit, explicit fixed priority or implicit priority
隐式、显式固定优先级或隐式优先级

1046
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:21,180
like the length of a job.
喜欢工作的时长。

1047
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:24,380
So you have this kind of a priority
所以你有这样的优先级

1048
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:26,460
which is encoded in the schedulers,
这是编码在调度程序中的。

1049
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:28,700
how schedulers make the decision.
调度器是如何做出决策的。

1050
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:34,580
It should raise a flag that you may then end up with starvation.
这应该引起警觉，因为你可能最终会面临饥饿的问题。

1051
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:41,700

1111
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:46,620
you basically decrease the priority of your--

And we are going to look a little bit about Linux,
然后我们要稍微了解一下Linux，

1120
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,540
how Linux is implemented.
Linux is implemented through the use of a kernel, which is the core component of the operating system. The kernel manages the system's resources, such as the processor, memory, and input/output devices. It also provides essential services, such as process management, file system access, and device drivers.

On top of the kernel, various software components are added to create a complete Linux distribution. These components include libraries, utilities, and applications that provide additional functionality and user interfaces. Different distributions may include different sets of software, but they all share the same Linux kernel.

Linux can be installed on a wide range of hardware platforms, from personal computers to servers, mobile devices, and embedded systems. It is known for its flexibility, stability, and security, making it a popular choice for both individual users and organizations.

1121
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:14,380
And then we are going to talk a little bit more about fairness.
然后我们将会更多地谈论公平性。

1122
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:19,220
With that, if there are any other questions I could answer,
有了这个，如果还有其他问题我可以回答的话，

1123

01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:29,420
Yeah, the deadlock there only happens--
是的，那里的僵局只发生在——

1125
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:32,340
that deadlock only happens here on spinlocks.
这个死锁只会在自旋锁这里发生。

1126
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:36,620
Yes, in that particular example, yes.
是的，在那个特定的例子中，是的。

1127
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:40,220
But yeah, but a deadlock is a much more general concept,
但是，死锁是一个更加普遍的概念，

1128
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,260
like we'll see next time.
