1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,540
Okay, awesome question.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,100
Thanks for the pointing this out. 

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,670
Sorry about that, everyone.

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,300
We have. 

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,740
Now, what are the rules for this year?

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,530
Still, mostly,

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,010
this class will be remote. 

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,160
All lecture will be remote. 

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,140
This is where the department decided, 

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,420
actually early on, 

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,420
even before delta variant, 

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,920
all exams will be remote, 

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,740
will have three midterms. 

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,780
There is no final. 

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:55,560
We have 17 discussion sections on thursday and fridays for on thursday, 

16
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,040
13 on friday. 

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,680
Out of those four will be in person. 

18
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,710
There will be on friday, 

19
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,410
and 30 will be remote. 

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,400
Now, please make sure because of that you have a working camera,

21
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:17,700
because you are going to have zoom procuring of exams and require

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,060
a section design reviews, 

23
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,690
working with your colleagues for the group projects, 

24
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,770
all requires to see each other and also screen shots. 

25
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,850
Goals of today lectures. 

26
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,330
It's an introductory lecture, obviously,

27
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,350
is to try to figure out a little bit what is an operating system. 

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,290
And in particular, also, what is not.

29
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:49,670
And also, 

30
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,940
i'm going to say a few words about what makes operating systems so exciting. 

31
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,930
It's a while and is actually probably one of the excite most exciting times

32
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,580
to study and work on operating systems. 

33
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,230
And then we are going to talk a little bit more at the end about how does

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,150
the class operate. 

35
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:14,850
Please, 

36
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,210
interactivity is important. 

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,090
Now I know that it's harder, 

38
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:25,190
especially with a weapon are i'm going to stop from time to time

39
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,580
and look and take questions. 

40
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,660
Please ask questions and notes, 

41
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,380
because even while I am talking, 

42
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,020
other people could answer them some of our t as

43
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,480
what is fundamentally an operating system. 

44
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,690
One way to think about the operating system is that software layer, 

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,110
which runs on top of hardware of the hardware and provide support to the application. 

46
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,500
Right? 

47
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,820
Why does it mean providing support to applications? 

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,350
Means that it makes it easier to develop applications on and take advantage

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,110
of the hardware capabilities. 

50
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,730
It also protects application from each others. 

51
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,160
It provides security and authentication, 

52
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:33,120
so only the applications which should a use a hardware and have access

53
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,000
to the data, 

54
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,320
and also provide support for cooperation. 

55
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,000
There are applications which cooperate with each other. 

56
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,830
Obviously, this is more and more expected today.

57
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,150
We are in the age of the internet. 

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,430
Right? 

59
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,760
Why do we care to provide support for applications? 

60
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,290
Because most of the things you do online, 

61
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,610
you do through applications. 

62
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,970
That's it, right?

63
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:06,460
It's the most a is a way people interact with computers is that people

64
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,540
are going to interact with the virtual world. 

65
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,260
So you have physical world, virtual world,

66
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,490
ritual or means application. 

67
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,670
And also to drive home, 

68
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:24,160
the.here are some numbers about how is a global mobile market size. 

69
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,380
You can see it is huge. 

70
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,860
And actually, 

71
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,300
even year over year, 

72
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,570
the growth is significant about 20% or more. 

73
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,720
Right? 

74
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,870
It's, again, an application provides the abstraction,

75
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,110
manages the resources, 

76
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,470
harder resources. 

77
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,720
It's achieving that through using a bunch of algorithms for scheduling

78
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,520
application or processes. 

79
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,470
Providing access to resources from different concurrent applications

80
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,070
running at the same time

81
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,100
and security and many more. 

82
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,850
Right now, 

83
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,210
let's look again a little bit. 

84
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,230
There is a question here. 

85
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,590
What is now what is now an exciting, 

86
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,690
why is now an exciting time for starting working hours? 

87
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,410
We are going to answer that later, 

88
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:41,690
because the impact of the os and the challenges are bigger than ever. 

89
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,930
That's a short answer. 

90
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,600
Here, again, it's not a problem during this lecture.

91
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,410
If you don't understand everything, this is pro.

92
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:01,450
We are aim here to provide some kind of end to end feeling about what

93
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,700
the operating system is doing. 

94
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,350
But the rest of the class you are going to dive in. 

95
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,370
We are going to look at all these aspects. 

96
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,490
I'm going to touch during this lecture in more detail. 

97
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,920
Basically, again, it's an application.

98
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,800
You want to run an application, run a program.

99
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,870
You run to one, you have to run it on top of the harbor.

100
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,120
Now, 

101
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,970
what is a harder consisting from of? 

102
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,510
You have a processor needs to execute the instructions to run your applications, 

103
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,480
and you clearly have a memory. 

104
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,280
Right? 

105
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,680
We store the data and store the program. 

106
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,120
You store the application code. 

107
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,440
The processors read the instructions and read the data, 

108
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,410
and executes those instructions on the data. 

109
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,120
And this is how your application is running. 

110
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,350
In addition to just memory, you have a cache,

111
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:11,140
keep the most recent data or the most access data around closer to the processor. 

112
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,420
This for, obviously, for improving the performance,

113
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:22,560
you have aa base table and tlb translation aside buffer this. 

114
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,350
Again, it's are the mechanisms for improving the performance.

115
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,630
Besides that, 

116
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,770
you have aa storage where you need to store the data as a program at rest. 

117
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,090
The process and memory are storing the data and run the program

118
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,650
only when they are powered on. 

119
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,050
Obviously, you have a lot of peripherals,

120
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,820
you have displays, 

121
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,810
you have mouse, 

122
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,620
you have network, 

123
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,700
you are connected to the internet and many more. 

124
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,510
So this is quite complex. 

125
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,370
Right? 

126
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,950
Now, the key here,

127
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,950
and they are connected, right?

128
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,710
All of these species are connected. 

129
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:12,710
The key here is basically how you are going to make easy and secure

130
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,010
for the application to run on this hardware and also take advantage

131
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,370
of the hardware capabilities. 

132
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,510
And many of these things you learn like there's a machine structure

133
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,950
in cx 61 c it's, 

134
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,310
again, 

135
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,890
one of the main functionality of the operating system is to abstract away

136
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,300
this hardware to the application. 

137
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,780
Let me, do I do this next set of few slides?

138
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,380
And then i'll stop for questions. 

139
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,530
So one way to think about operating system is this like you lose honest. 

140
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,520
Right? 

141
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,040
Why is that? 

142
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:04,720
Because again, 

143
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,680
it's provides this kind of abstraction of the physical resources. 

144
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,870
The abstractions are much easier to use and the applications

145
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,970
than the application using directly the harbor. 

146
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,380
One of the way it makes it easier to use the operating system makes

147
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,000
easier for the application to use is removing limitations. 

148
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,250
Right? 

149
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,210
For instance, it provides you the illusion to the eu being the application,

150
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,960
the illusion that you are the only one, 

151
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,720
the application is the only one using that machine. 

152
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,930
It provides the illusion that the memory is like infinite. 

153
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,740
There are no limits, right?

154
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,620
It provides the illusion, you have files,

155
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,900
and data stored in files. 

156
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,820
You have users, you have messages.

157
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:57,840
So like, 

158
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,000
it's a much higher level of abstraction than operating just on beats. 

159
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:12,470
And the main way the operating system provides abstracts. 

160
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,800
This resources, 

161
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,720
harder resources to the application is through the process. 

162
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,540
The process is execution environment in which the applications run. 

163
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,540
And the process consists of threads. 

164
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,300
This is basically the concept, 

165
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,700
the unit of execution. 

166
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,590
It's our address space. 

167
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,730
This is a unit kind of allocates allocation, right?

168
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,450
Allocate resources. 

169
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,130
And you allocate addresses memory, 

170
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:57,020
and you have access to files and sockets to communicate over network. 

171
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:05,650
The process encapsulate and provides all this abstraction to the application. 

172
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,120
The application only need to understand about how to operate on threads, 

173
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,270
another space, how to rewrite files,

174
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,970
how to communicate our sockets, 

175
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,670
so to communicate our network. 

176
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,050
So that's it much easier. 

177
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,450
How does application take advantage? 

178
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,370
You write the code and you compile the code. 

179
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,620
Your code is not only the code you are writing, 

180
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,660
but it's are going to use also libraries and a bunch of system libraries, 

181
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,430
which are coming with any operating system. 

182
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,340
Again, to summarize,

183
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,620
the application view of machine is that of the process. 

184
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,310
Each application program runs in its own process. 

185
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,670
This process provides this much, higher level,

186
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,920
much nicer interfaces, then they are harder.

187
00:11:59,070 --> 00:11:59,540
Okay? 

188
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,750
It's again here you can see. 

189
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,990
It's like I mentioned, 

190
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,470
you have the program, 

191
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,590
the code you write, 

192
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,980
which is going to use some calls to the system libraries, 

193
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,640
which are going basically to implement this api for this abstraction

194
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,920
of our api its application programming interfaces, 

195
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,150
to manipulate these abstractions. 

196
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,050
And then you take care of this, you compile it,

197
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,830
you get the executable code and that you run it on your machine. 

198
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,840
Let me stop here. 

199
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,870
And let's see, 

200
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,110
there is a question. 

201
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,070
What else do you like the best? 

202
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,850
I think that's a good question. 

203
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,740
I think, look,

204
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,440
it's like you. 

205
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,680
I'm not going to surprise you here. 

206
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,040
I think there are two systems which are quite good. 

207
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,900
It's and i'm using them. 

208
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,840
It's linux and macros. 

209
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,400
Mac west. 

210
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,760
We are going to talk about that. 

211
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:13,060
It's actually build also of the unique bsd which originated from berkeley. 

212
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,240
So, 

213
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,170
okay, 

214
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,410
so please ask questions and sorry, 

215
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,490
again, 

216
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,730
i've never used a minor. 

217
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,650
We are using it because it's more scalable, 

218
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,600
but is less interactive. 

219
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,530
So, 

220
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,090
but we promise to improve on using these tools. 

221
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,730
So excellent. 

222
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,200
Again, just to summarize,

223
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,360
and i'm going to repeat a lot of things, 

224
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,800
a lot of over and over again. 

225
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,370
So hopefully i'm not going to borrow you, 

226
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,410
but there are actually not a lot of big concepts you are going to love

227
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,130
in this class, 

228
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,350
but the concepts are quite difficult and intricate it. 

229
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,700
And also because they are going to interpret and interact with each other. 

230
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,550
But just to summarize, 

231
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,070
a process consists of an address space, 

232
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,900
one or more thread. 

233
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,620
And this is the control, 

234
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,940
the execution in that other space, 

235
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,270
a bunch of other resources, like files,

236
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,550
sockets, and things like that.

237
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,340
This is activity monitor. 

238
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,420
If you have a mac, if you go on here,

239
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,040
you can look and you can see all these processes. 

240
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,350
You can see, actually, the processes that tells you also,

241
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,630
I think the column probably i'm not sure you see my mouse, 

242
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,320
but there is a column here called threats, 

243
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:50,940
right? 

244
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,070
This is unit of execution. 

245
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,200
Basically, for chrome, here,

246
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,240
you have 22 threads, 

247
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:07,040
22 activities which are running concurrently in the same process. 

248
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,320
Okay, so that's fine.

249
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:10,350
Again, 

250
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,470
we obstructing away harder resources to the applications. 

251
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:24,310
It's one of the main main things

252
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,410
that the application is that the operating system is doing the main capabilities. 

253
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,780
Now, less,

254
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,540
we are going to look for other car. 

255
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:39,260
We are going to go over the other capabilities as the operating system provides, 

256
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,560
and to illustrate the need for the next one. 

257
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,460
Now assume that you are going to have not only one program, 

258
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,560
but two programs to applications running on your machine. 

259
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,930
And that every actually today, 

260
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,940
almost every computer, 

261
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,820
your laptop, 

262
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,180
your phone, 

263
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,720
allows you to run multiple applications, 

264
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,160
which means multiple processes at the same time. 

265
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:10,580
Right? 

266
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,650
This now, 

267
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,290
the point is that it's, again,

268
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,410
it's like one of the abstractions. 

269
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,010
Remember that I mentioned that the operations operating system provides

270
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,320
to the application is that

271
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,190
provides the illusion of a dedicated machine. 

272
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:30,560
Right? 

273
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,170
But now how you are going to do it when you are going to have

274
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,480
multiple applications running at the same time, 

275
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,000
because they are going to run on the same hardware. 

276
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,770
Here is where it comes this kind of the other way you can look

277
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,890
at the operating system as a fairy, 

278
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,880
because the only way you can provide the illusion of two applications, 

279
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,560
and each of them, 

280
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,720
they have their own virtual machine. 

281
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,450
So to speak is to protect one of each other, 

282
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,680
to isolate one of each other. 

283
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:06,760
Right? 

284
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,440
That's the only way here. 

285
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,400
It's just, 

286
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,730
let's go in a little bit more details to illustrate the need for that. 

287
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,190
Now, 

288
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,170
let's start with a processor. 

289
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,970
So you have only one processor, 

290
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,740
and you have two applications, 

291
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,740
and you have to run on the same processor. 

292
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,220
At a given time, you can run on the processor,

293
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:35,400
only one application to give the illusion that both of them are going to run. 

294
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,400
They have their own machines. 

295
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,120
So to speak, 

296
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,700
the way you do it is that you are going to divide the processor time

297
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,910
in slots or slices. 

298
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,490
Each slice, you have a different application running.

299
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,050
The slices are a few million seconds. 

300
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,510
1 millisecond, 10 millisecond things like is something like that.

301
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,210
Right? 

302
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,610
In this particular example, 

303
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,880
you have the brown application running. 

304
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,100
If you can see here, 

305
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,320
the processor access is a memory, 

306
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:16,190
which is in the process allocated to the brown process one. 

307
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,090
It read it reads a code and executes that code. 

308
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,260
Is there for running program on? 

309
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,130
Right? 

310
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,190
But now, 

311
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:28,780
next, 

312
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,350
you will also have program two, support.

313
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,510
Program two in memory, 

314
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,630
also have some piece of, 

315
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,690
you also have some piece of memory which is allocated to process, 

316
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,380
right? 

317
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,120
At some point,  Right?

318
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,160
You run at some.. 

319
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:47,720
Now. 

320
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,480
I said after a little bit of time, 

321
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,720
you allocate to program one to run. 

322
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,130
Now you are going to switch the program, too.

323
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,400
You are going to run. 

324
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,070
And by doing so and switching at a very high frequency, 

325
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:09,830
you give the evening is an illusion to each of these applications that it's

326
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,750
using the computer allowed. 

327
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,120
Right? 

328
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,250
Now, the problem here, if you can see, for instance,

329
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,610
if you look at the memory, 

330
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,370
you're having the same memory, 

331
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,410
physical memory. 

332
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,890
You have the data from multiple applications, 

333
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,320
and they have to to read and write the data. 

334
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,000
Right? 

335
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,340
And certainly, 

336
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,580
you do not want, 

337
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,990
say, in this case,

338
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:41,630
a program to our process to read or even more to write the data in process on. 

339
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:42,880
Right? 

340
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,720
You also don't run the any process store for that matter. 

341
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:54,430
Of fact, any process to write to modify the operating system memory.

342
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:56,560
Right? 

343
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,320
Because then the operating system may crash. 

344
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,460
If you write up an application, 

345
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,240
modify the operating system in memory. 

346
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,550
And also you need to be careful with the storage. 

347
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:10,350
Right? 

348
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,920
You shouldn't allow one program, 

349
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:21,070
two of one user to modify the data of another users, 

350
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,420
especially if that data is private or read it. 

351
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:26,650
Okay? 

352
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,900
So this is what we mean. 

353
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,550
Now you need to you protect protection, 

354
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,480
so you need to protect one application, 

355
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,760
one process from another. 

356
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,400
You need to protect one process from the operating system, 

357
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,800
and protect the operating system from the process. 

358
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:45,720
Right? 

359
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:56,230
When an application on a program tries to execute some of these actions, 

360
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:04,460
which are precluded like accessing the data of the memory, 

361
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,410
which belongs to another process, 

362
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,870
or accessing the memory belongs to the operating system. 

363
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,840
The operating system, 

364
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,140
one way is going to deal with this offending application, 

365
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,870
is crashing the processing segmentation fault. 

366
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:25,770
But it's, again,

367
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:32,410
the main point here is that in order to create this illusion of to

368
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,380
a process that they are using the machine alone, 

369
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,450
you need to isolate and to protect processes from each other. 

370
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,680
Also, 

371
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:47,320
in order to make sure that the operating system itself is not crashes a as

372
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,120
a result, 

373
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,890
processes modifying operating system data, 

374
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:03,420
then we need also to isolate the operating system itself from the processes. 

375
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,030
Right? 

376
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,820
Let's see. 

377
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,590
I was looking at the question, 

378
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,030
why is a good time for learning oils right now? 

379
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:26,440
It's again, we are going stick around until for the next half an hour or.

380
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,350
So so now, 

381
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:38,740
the last way we can look at the operating system is like a glue. 

382
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:39,960
Right? 

383
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,030
Why is that? 

384
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,700
Again, 

385
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,070
it's very logic, right?

386
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,750
Illogical. 

387
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,780
First, 

388
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,430
you need to abstract those harder to make it

389
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,870
much easier for the application developers to write applications. 

390
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,770
Second, 

391
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,040
you need to provide protection, isolations,

392
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,930
because typically, you are going to have multiple applications,

393
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,250
multiple processes, 

394
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,000
sharing the same part. 

395
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,300
And the final part is that these applications or some applications

396
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,510
are communicating with each other. 

397
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:26,090
So you need to provide some kind of glue between them to provide

398
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,810
some common services. 

399
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,220
This is coming the form of networking or storage. 

400
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,750
You can application can communicate through files, 

401
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,950
one application write in a files, 

402
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,470
another application read from a file. 

403
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,320
Obviously, this also comes with authorization and things like that.

404
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:56,940
But this is where you can think about the operating system as a glue. 

405
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,340
Right? 

406
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,390
They need to provide the communications, 

407
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,030
enable you the ability to share the resources. 

408
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,760
And again, 

409
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:16,440
the common the operating system is doing that by providing these common services, 

410
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,290
file systems, networking,

411
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,400
so forth. 

412
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,080
I'm going to stop here. 

413
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,480
Are there any questions? 

414
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,660
One question is, 

415
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,700
what are the methods that allow different processes to talk with each other? 

416
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,020
I know your socket communication. 

417
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,100
It's a valid method. 

418
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,100
So there are a few of them, 

419
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,220
and we are going to learn about them. 

420
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,210
One is me soccer communication, 

421
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,530
so it's like networking. 

422
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,530
Right? 

423
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,420
You can communicate with each other to processes whether they are

424
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,740
on the same machine or different machines, 

425
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,260
through sockets, through a network interface.

426
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,220
The processes which are on the same machine, 

427
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,620
they can also communicate through share memory. 

428
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,520
You can also have the ability to communicate with share memory. 

429
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,440
And also, like I mentioned earlier,

430
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,400
you can communicate through storage. 

431
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,630
An application can write a piece of data on the store on the local file system, 

432
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,150
or even for a global file system. 

433
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,570
And others application can read. 

434
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,180
Okay? 

435
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,980
Is a processor just what we call a cpu? 

436
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,760
For most cases, these are interchangeable,

437
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,950
although we are also going to call processor like specialized, harder,

438
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,570
specialized processors, 

439
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:55,470
several. 

440
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,910
So it's a little bit broader, 

441
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,120
but unless has a right specified the equivalence. 

442
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,550
Ha ha ha. 

443
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,830
Will adam replace x 86 in consumer space? 

444
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:15,640
Ii it's clear that autumn has a lot of momentum right now. 

445
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,790
One example, 

446
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,230
obviously, it's m one from apple.

447
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,020
You see that become more and more proud, powerful,

448
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:34,750
but there are also arm starts to be deployed in data centers. 

449
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:41,530
Actually, there is one new instance which from amazon called graviton.

450
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,250
This is around armed processor. 

451
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,210
And it's quite fast. 

452
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,500
It's actually his very good performance and is cheaper. 

453
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,710
Now, we'll see, right?

454
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,090
Because what intel is going to do, 

455
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,520
clearly, they announce a bunch of initiatives,

456
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,360
but adam, 

457
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:09,180
it's has a lot of momentum at this.. 

458
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:22,010
Let me go here. 

459
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,380
There is something about visualization. 

460
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,740
There is something about there are a few more questions here. 

461
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,240
Let me ask answer them. 

462
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,320
It's one question on the chap. 

463
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:47,960
By the way, please try to ask question for on q and a so I have one source.

464
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,350
I can read them from. 

465
00:27:52,240 --> 00:28:00,900
So there's a lot of there are some comments about vmy about visualization. 

466
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:06,420
We are going to talk about visualization even a little bit during this lecture. 

467
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:14,120
But visualization is a way to provide the illusion to every process

468
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,690
to every application that they are using. 

469
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,470
They're using alone the machine. 

470
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,330
There is another question about risk five. 

471
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,900
This obviously was done at berkeley. 

472
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:34,890
I think these five it's has a great future. 

473
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,560
And for those of you don't know, 

474
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:42,200
at least five is an open instruction set architecture, 

475
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:48,060
which means that you don't need to pay any license to use it, 

476
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,510
to build process to build processors around it. 

477
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,000
In contrast, arm for arm,

478
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:03,650
you need to pay life license in order to use and to provide the art

479
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,820
of instruction set. 

480
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,900
But risk five. 

481
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:21,670
Now it's targeting internet of things or mobile devices, very low power.

482
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,010
This is how they started, 

483
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,250
but this is the way they are started. 

484
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,860
So you'll see maybe a risk. 

485
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:36,550
There is a chance that are going to follow the trajectory of arm. 

486
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,450
And it can become for arm what arm is for into. 

487
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,830
But again, it's obvious this is in the future,

488
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,290
but obviously, 

489
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,890
it has a lot of promise. 

490
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,570
I'm going to go back now to the lecture slides. 

491
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,140
Again, 

492
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:12,970
this is give examples about some of the services which are provided

493
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,090
by the operating system. 

494
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,650
We didn't discuss so far. 

495
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:24,630
And some of the management services and does the operating system provides, 

496
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,110
and maybe you do not think right away to them. 

497
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,090
It's like power management, 

498
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:30,450
correct? 

499
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,940
Or especially for mobile devices, 

500
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,890
you need to manage the power. 

501
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,950
And across the application, 

502
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,510
if you have an application which user is proportionate amount of battery, 

503
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,070
maybe you want to isolate to protect other applications from that. 

504
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,740
You need to manage a network. 

505
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,940
You need to manage almost every shared resource, 

506
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,200
right? 

507
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,980
When I I referred shared by multiple applications. 

508
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,250
So in summary, 

509
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,560
it's, again,

510
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:03,930
repeating. 

511
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,540
There are three things. 

512
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,600
An operating system is doing. 

513
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:14,950
One is providing a clean easy to use abstractions of the physical resources

514
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,030
to the application, 

515
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:20,210
make it much easier for application developers to develop this application. 

516
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,350
And this means like you can think about this, 

517
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,470
like is like you lose your list, 

518
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,430
then which follows from providing clean abstractions. 

519
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,150
You can think about operating system as a referee. 

520
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,650
And in this case, 

521
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:43,630
the operating system provides protection and isolation of shared resources across

522
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,000
for multiple applications. 

523
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,310
Right? 

524
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,270
We share those resources. 

525
00:31:53,120 --> 00:32:01,050
And the final is that it's a glue that operating system provides common

526
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:07,540
services in particularly also enables this application to communicate

527
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,260
to each other. 

528
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,960
So now, 

529
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:21,200
let's talk a little bit more about cs one city to, 

530
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:21,980
in general, 

531
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:28,710
and then talk a little bit about why now and why it's exciting and challenging. 

532
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,990
Why take cs on ct two? 

533
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,510
It's again, 

534
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,370
because some of you will actually design and build operating system

535
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,250
or components of them like file systems, 

536
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:40,450
right? 

537
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,370
You go to google, 

538
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,770
you may work on android. 

539
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,300
For instance, you go like apple,

540
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,240
you may or microsoft, 

541
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,880
you may work on their operating systems, 

542
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:58,530
or if you are to any company which depend running its software on linux, 

543
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:04,230
you might work on linux to provide new capabilities for the applications

544
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,410
that are important for your company. 

545
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,950
But many of you are going to build software which run on top

546
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,030
of the operating systems. 

547
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,610
And to build better software, 

548
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,610
you need to understand how the operating system was working. 

549
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,980
You need to understand to the concepts. 

550
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,060
That's what it is. 

551
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,310
So next, 

552
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,110
i'm going to talk about what makes operating system exciting and challenging. 

553
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,800
Let me check again for the questions. 

554
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,310
How can application interact with these common services

555
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,220
through the api application programming interfaces? 

556
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,140
I mentioned a little bit in passing earlier on. 

557
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:08,530
These are exposed by system libraries. 

558
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,090
Right? 

559
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,570
For instance, if you want to access a file,

560
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:17,140
you are going to have an api to access that file, read, write,

561
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:22,340
seek the same for sending our communication, 

562
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,570
sending and receiving data. 

563
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,880
You are going to have another api and this is exposed

564
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:32,190
by these system libraries and implement it. 

565
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,770
Why does searching for files from windows? 

566
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,530
File explorer for this feels super slow? 

567
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,870
Unfortunately, I don't know.

568
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,950
Ii have no answer to that question, 

569
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,800
but if you get the answer, 

570
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,160
i'll be interested in the answer. 

571
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:56,430
In short, what makes the system,

572
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,910
the operating system? 

573
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,070
Now, 

574
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,860
extremely exciting is because there are many things happen. 

575
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,810
In the next few slides, 

576
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,190
i'm going to tell you what happens. 

577
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:13,200
And these things actually makes operating systems, 

578
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,980
addressing the operating system problems more difficult, 

579
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,430
and hopefully more rewarding once you solve the problems. 

580
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,710
So as you probably know, 

581
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:33,450
i'm sure everyone heard that many times for the more than 50 years, 

582
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,030
all our industry, 

583
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,050
hardware industry, software industry,

584
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,960
and large part was really driven by the morsel. 

585
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,100
Machines are harder, 

586
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:52,200
becoming more and more powerful, very fast.

587
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,990
So according to gordon moore, 

588
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,300
who was a co founder of intel, 

589
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,130
in 65, 

590
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:04,610
he predicted that the transistor density of semiconductor chips will double

591
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,010
roughly every 2 years. 

592
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,290
There's a morse law, right?

593
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,010
And you have this plus here. 

594
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,810
You see a line, 

595
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,250
but you have see a line on the x axis is a time on the y axis. 

596
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,150
It's the performance or the number of transistors. 

597
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,120
And you have a line y because the y axis is in log scale. 

598
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:32,210
Now, 

599
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:40,500
morris law says the transistor density doubles roughly every 2 years. 

600
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,700
So on the same area, 

601
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,630
you can cram twice as many transistors. 

602
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:53,890
This leads to the performance of the processor doubling roughly every 18 months. 

603
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,270
Why discrepancy? 

604
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,240
The discrepancy is? 

605
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,840
Because since the transistors are becoming closer to each other, 

606
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:08,190
the latency between transistors to communicate between transistors decreases. 

607
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:14,810
And therefore, you have double reasons you have that are these compounds

608
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,940
to increasing the transistor density. 

609
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,670
And therefore, 

610
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,070
the performance increases a little bit faster, 

611
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,280
or used to increase a little bit faster. 

612
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,880
The challenge is that the modest law ended. 

613
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,260
Okay? 

614
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,000
This again, 

615
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:48,750
it shows here is a performance versus time the performance

616
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,000
of a single court for processor. 

617
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:58,350
And between 1995 and2002 or 2003, 

618
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,210
this was what you see here is green. 

619
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,940
This is the golden age, 

620
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,020
so to speak, 

621
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,950
because in this period, 

622
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:16,600
but 4 months increased, 

623
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,600
doubled every 18 months, 

624
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,410
or increase 52% of the year. 

625
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:30,800
And the problem right now is that this performance will call increasing

626
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,520
just a few percent every year. 

627
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,650
So this is a big problem. 

628
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,980
Why it is a big problem, 

629
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,100
because at that time, 

630
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:52,980
when the capabilities of a single core basically are no longer increasing, 

631
00:38:55,050 --> 00:39:00,040
the demands of the new applications are increasing faster than ever. 

632
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:04,760
Here, 

633
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,370
it's a plot open. 

634
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:08,930
I plot. 

635
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,770
Many of you may have seen it. 

636
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:20,320
And it shows Compute cup requirements to train the state of the art models. 

637
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:25,700
This is plot was going back to 2012 was published in 2019. 

638
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,100
Again, it's a lot of scale.

639
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,090
If you look here, 

640
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,280
this growth is absolutely astounding. 

641
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,970
The requirements, 

642
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,640
computer requirements grew 35 times every 18 months. 

643
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,490
I added here another data point for 2020. 

644
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,570
A new model was released. 

645
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,730
If you remember a little more than 1 year ago, 

646
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,130
gpt three from open ai made a lot of waves. 

647
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:03,340
It has 175, 

648
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,920
55 million parameters. 

649
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,160
And again, it fits a curve.

650
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,210
This, again, is not only as aesthetic models.

651
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:19,390
You have models like with the gpt three is actually language model, 

652
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,060
video model, 

653
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,230
pattern recognition, 

654
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,670
and things like that. 

655
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,510
And now here is a morse law. 

656
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,910
Actually, it's a morse law.

657
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,790
Even forget that it ended, 

658
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,450
even if it were intended, 

659
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,720
a we would be in a big trouble. 

660
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,050
But it ended. 

661
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,090
And this is actually how the morse law looked like. 

662
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,020
You see, is a gap.

663
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,770
This is huge, and this is explanation.

664
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,770
It's, again, the law a you have a log scale here.

665
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:57,590
And the gap increases exponentially every year or every day if you want. 

666
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,210
So now what do you do about it? 

667
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:04,750
Right? 

668
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,150
You heard about specialized processors. 

669
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,540
You have gp us like and media, 

670
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:25,390
gpsa 100 is the latest on dp us from ten several processor units from google, 

671
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,660
sarah brass. 

672
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:31,040
This is a company building huge chips, 

673
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,510
very powerful. 

674
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:38,680
And any of everyone else builds their own version of gpu intel alchemist, 

675
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,840
your announcement, 

676
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,020
md radium, and so forth.

677
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,580
The main idea here, 

678
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,480
obviously, 

679
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:54,500
we specialize harder is that you are going to narrow the workloads you

680
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,380
want to support, 

681
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,950
because of that, 

682
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,630
more about that workload. 

683
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,540
So you can do more optimization, 

684
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:05,870
and you can be smarter in the way you design the chip. 

685
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,830
You increase the parallelism and things like that. 

686
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:15,860
So you can make it much faster for that workload than a general purpose processor, 

687
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:17,720
right? 

688
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,940
But now you need to program these things as well. 

689
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,980
You may need to share these things as well. 

690
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,110
Right? 

691
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:28,140
And they are going to be quite different from the cp us. 

692
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,580
And who has to deal with that. 

693
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,030
As big as stand, 

694
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,390
your operating system has to be with it. 

695
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:44,490
Now, the problem is that even with this specialized hardware,

696
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:47,810
they help, 

697
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:52,010
obviously, there are more powerful than a single call,

698
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,200
but still, 

699
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,690
they don't close the gap. 

700
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,490
Here, 

701
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:10,890
it's the performance of the gp os and of the tp os on the same on the same block. 

702
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,080
And there is a start here, basically same.

703
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:22,290
We are assuming in order to make sense and to normalize. 

704
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,310
Typically, aspect,

705
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,470
in particular, based on open ai data,

706
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,790
the utilization of the hardware by this, 

707
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,270
the state of the art training algorithms is like 33%. 

708
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:41,020
When I show the performance of the gp us and dp us here, 

709
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,980
I am factoring it for that utilization. 

710
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,330
So that's huge problem, right?

711
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,630
Even with the cp us and gp us, 

712
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,450
and is a memory demands are growing as fast, even faster.

713
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,100
Here, 

714
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,550
it's a log scale is a number of parameters of these models. 

715
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,690
This is from 2016. 

716
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,490
And now the last.is, 

717
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,850
this is from china. 

718
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:26,370
And this is1.70 55 trillion parameters. 

719
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,700
So it's 10 times larger than gpt three. 

720
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:33,840
I'm sure you are going to hear about other announcement, 

721
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,040
even bigger models. 

722
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,040
If you plot and if you look at this data, it's again itself, again,

723
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:39,720
lock scale. 

724
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,740
Although it may not look like, 

725
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,720
since 2016, 

726
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:47,160
the size of this model increased 40 times, 

727
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:48,240
every 18 months. 

728
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,470
And if you look at the last 3 years, 

729
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,080
300, 40 times.

730
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:54,570
Right? 

731
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,460
This is phenomenal. 

732
00:44:58,830 --> 00:44:59,790
During this time, 

733
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,740
the gpu memory, 

734
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,230
1.7 x every 18 months. 

735
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,980
It used to be not a few years back. 

736
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:10,120
Right? 

737
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:13,200
In 2017, eighteen,

738
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:20,040
you can feed the largest models on a single gpu now, 

739
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,610
you need more than 1,000 gp us to just to store the parameters

740
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:25,650
of the largest models. 

741
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,650
So let's see, 

742
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,490
what are the other trends? 

743
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,760
Now let's move to storage capacity. 

744
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,840
Storage capacity is still growing exponentially. 

745
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,440
The one thing here, 

746
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:54,290
it used to be dominating the storage by harvest drives no longer. 

747
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,060
Now you have more and more solid state devices. 

748
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:02,780
You can see here, the capacity of a solid,

749
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:11,830
a a solid state drive started to exceed in 2015, 16.

750
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:19,820
That of the so the biggest ssd drive exceeded the capacity of the biggest

751
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:24,030
harvest drive around to fifteen to 6 to 16. 

752
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:29,740
And today, if you are looking the largest ssd3.5 inch drive,

753
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:31,660
it's 100 terabytes. 

754
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,350
The largest ssd is 18 terabytes. 

755
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:36,830
Now, 

756
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:42,450
you are going to pay dearly for this 100 terabyte ssd drive. 

757
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:47,230
It costs 40 k is 400 per terabytes. 

758
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,600
While to get 18 terabytes, they say,

759
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:52,560
sorry, this is hardest drive.

760
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,920
I'm going to just correct this one. 

761
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,880
For that, you pay only $600,

762
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,750
a 33 dull pet terabytes. 

763
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:11,500
Now, 

764
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:17,900
you can have more economical or economical choices when you look at the ss ds, 

765
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:18,540
like, for instance,

766
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:23,590
if you under four terabytes ssd it costs $95 better up. 

767
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,790
Terabyte still more expensive than the harvest stripes. 

768
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:28,470
Despite of this, 

769
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,000
the ss ds are winning the war. 

770
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,560
There is little question about that. 

771
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,170
Why? 

772
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,250
Because the hardest drive are cheaper, 

773
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,890
but they are much slower. 

774
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,590
Sometimes between ten x and 100 x consumes much more power, 

775
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:49,870
very important for data center and mobile devices or laptops. 

776
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,940
And they are less reliable. 

777
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,810
These are some projections to make to drive home that point

778
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,010
on the left hand side. 

779
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:09,640
It's about, you can see different technologies is projected up to 2030.

780
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:17,780
You can have here with dark blue is ss ds with light blue. 

781
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:18,860
It's a flash. 

782
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:24,530
So this is usb the storage in your camera and things like that. 

783
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,490
And then the yellow is actually our tapes. 

784
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:29,920
So all the technology, 

785
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:31,880
probably many of you have never seen a tape, 

786
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:33,900
but they are very cheap. 

787
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,500
That's why. 

788
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:40,700
And then o is dark orange or with orange is actually harvest lives. 

789
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:50,720
Also, the same study anticipate that in 2026, actually,

790
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
the ss ds will be cheaper per terabytes and hardest drives. 

791
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:59,000
And that's why probably you are going to see on the left hand side, 

792
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:08,220
a point in around 2025 after which the market share of and

793
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:12,360
not only of the harvest drive is going to decrease. 

794
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:19,360
Networking still going very fast. 

795
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:27,710
Today you can have 100 garbage connections to your machines in aws next

796
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,710
will be probably 400 garbage per second. 

797
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,300
There are other factors, right?

798
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:34,040
It's like, 

799
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,300
for instance, 

800
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:47,670
another important aspect is the fact that it used to be early on. 

801
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:54,100
You have very, few huge computer computers.

802
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:55,780
They are extremely expensive, 

803
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:57,260
tens of millions of dollars. 

804
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:03,720
In that case, you have a lot of people using the same machine.

805
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,080
Right? 

806
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,540
Actually, in 60s, if I remember correct or 50s,

807
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:17,290
when ibm started the to to build computers, 

808
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,430
watson, 

809
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,990
who was the founder of the ibm and the ceo was saying that he

810
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,090
doesn't believe that there is a need, 

811
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,690
then for more than five or six computers in the entire united states. 

812
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,750
Of course, over time,

813
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:42,430
the computers have proliferated becomes smaller and smaller. 

814
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:46,600
It used to be probably in 2000s. 

815
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,440
At the end of the previous century, 

816
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,810
you have one user, one computer.

817
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:56,060
And now you have a user. 

818
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,800
One user is many computers, right?

819
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,440
If you're in your car alone, 

820
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,940
you have ten and send ten of cp us. 

821
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:06,070
Right? 

822
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,210
So this change, 

823
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,660
and as you can imagine, 

824
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:15,250
this also is going to impact the way you are going to design the operating system. 

825
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:19,530
There is another aspect here. 

826
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:26,870
There is an extreme range of time scales. 

827
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,170
This is from jeff dean of google, 

828
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:34,990
very influential computer scientist, 

829
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,540
build many of the distributed systems there. 

830
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:45,440
If you look about from an application and the operating system, 

831
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,640
you have to deal with a latency as low as lower than normal. 

832
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:54,240
No, second, this is l one cash, this is a cash,

833
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:58,760
which is the first level cash which is on chip. 

834
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:02,420
All the way. 

835
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:07,220
If you are going to send a packet to communicate with someone in california

836
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:08,180
to netherlands, 

837
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:09,790
what? 

838
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,030
It's 150 million seconds. 

839
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:16,830
So you need to handle a scale, 

840
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:18,750
a difference in scale, 

841
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,230
in the range of what? 

842
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,100
Eight order of magnitude more. 

843
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,830
Basically, 

844
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,110
let me actually stop here and see what are the questions. 

845
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:51,230
Why does industry intel, 

846
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,960
apple say the onslaught is not over? 

847
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:07,610
So the morse law from that very definition of the morse law, 

848
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,480
it is pretty much over. 

849
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,280
It's physical, 

850
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,270
right? 

851
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:18,380
What they say is that what this company say, 

852
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,190
it's fundamentally look, 

853
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:25,520
if the morse law, 

854
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:29,840
if you say that the morse law is over and i'm building chips, 

855
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:30,600
why would you build? 

856
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:31,960
Why would you buy chips from me? 

857
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:35,600
Because this means that the new chips will be the same like the old chips. 

858
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:37,960
No more power, right?

859
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,910
So there is a little bit also of, 

860
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:43,910
they said, 

861
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,850
I cannot say that the morse law is, 

862
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,330
it's over, 

863
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:52,980
because the morse law is what the public associated with the performance. 

864
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:53,780
Right? 

865
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,450
So it's a little bit of also marketing. 

866
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,500
The more slow is over, 

867
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:04,100
but the more slow it has a very precise definition. 

868
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,920
And these companies they talk to the public. 

869
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,100
And the public doesn't know the precise definition. 

870
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:13,660
Now, a small, slow means it means fast.

871
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:15,540
Things become faster and faster. 

872
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,810
Now, in truth, they use a lot of other techniques.

873
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:25,590
And we are going to talk about those in order to improve the performance. 

874
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:27,210
Right? 

875
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:32,580
And this is very visible in your iphone or in your android phone. 

876
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:35,770
We'll talk a little bit about how they do it, 

877
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,140
but that is not by improving necessary. 

878
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:45,100
The performance of a single core is by adding gp us, 

879
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,340
neural engines, 

880
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,400
adding more course, 

881
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:51,730
things like that. 

882
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:54,920
We'll talk more about it. 

883
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,030
But good question. 

884
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:03,430
There are programs like spark and made videos that allow us to use

885
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,390
networks or computers to process a parallel workload. 

886
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,630
But would it be feasible to create some type of operating system

887
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:14,100
of software that could string together resources of multiple

888
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,500
computers for personal consumer use? 

889
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:21,100
I think

890
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,900
the question is it's a distributed operating system. 

891
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:32,890
I think that there is not a coherent operating system, 

892
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:36,910
but the elements of a operating system dispute operating system

893
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,270
are already there. 

894
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:45,520
Because one thing can you probably know about cuba net is cabernet is

895
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:47,720
provides resource orchestration, 

896
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:52,970
resource management over multiple machines, over a cluster.

897
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:54,500
That's one. 

898
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,370
The now that then you have distributed file systems, 

899
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:00,010
right? 

900
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,890
Like hdfs or you have these blob stores like, 

901
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:05,390
i'm as I double ss three. 

902
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:09,160
We'll talk more to towards the end of the class. 

903
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:10,800
It's a good question. 

904
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,540
Probably you should expect that at some point, 

905
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:19,130
you are going to see this kind of pieces coming

906
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,540
together in a more coherent way in what you could call

907
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:23,780
a distributed operating system. 

908
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,100
So fundamentally, 

909
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,550
it's again. 

910
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,970
So why things are exciting? 

911
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,380
Because they are challenging. 

912
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,610
Why are things challenging? 

913
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,460
Because they are complex. 

914
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,610
And this complexity, 

915
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:49,670
it's growing fast. 

916
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,120
Why is complexity growing? 

917
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,530
Because you have the demands of the new application

918
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,090
are growing faster than ever. 

919
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:02,310
Capabilities of us of the harder are no longer growing like they used to be. 

920
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:08,010
So then you need to add to innovate on the architecture. 

921
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,810
You have different specialized chips. 

922
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,100
You need to distribute these applications. 

923
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,130
You need to parallelize the programs and many more. 

924
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,230
And i'll talk a little more about it. 

925
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,870
And then the applications themselves are more complicated. 

926
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:33,940
The application goes to have a variety of software modules. 

927
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,740
And we'll talk more about that. 

928
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:36,660
But remember, 

929
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,690
if you have almost every application you are using today is not running

930
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,890
on only on your machine, 

931
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,170
it has a back and use facebook. 

932
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:49,360
A lot of things happen in the back and use google

933
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:55,140
or any other google applications and80% is into the backup. 

934
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,710
Do it at everything almost right net flicks name it. 

935
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:00,510
Right? 

936
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:06,340
And then it has to run a different heart of architectures. 

937
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,920
And because of the more slow has ended, 

938
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:11,400
you are going to have or to see a proliferation. 

939
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:14,160
You are already seeing a proliferation of hardware architectures. 

940
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,470
Just to give you an example here, 

941
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:23,410
and it's a personal example when he started spark and he started in 2009. 

942
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,820
So what 12 years ago, 

943
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,640
we are focusing only for processing data, 

944
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,280
which is in the memory efficiently, 

945
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:32,760
and we are focusing only on cp us. 

946
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:33,700
Right? 

947
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:37,990
It's like we assume that the processing is done by the general purpose, 

948
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:45,250
proposed processors that I end up when he started ray, 

949
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,950
which was that was happening like in 2016. 

950
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,910
So it's after only67 years, 

951
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:58,080
we already have to take into account and to design it

952
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:02,430
for heterogeneous harder to handle gp us at that time. 

953
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,190
Now, to handle gp us and so forth, this is real.

954
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,230
Obviously, this comes with additional complexity.

955
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:13,900
It's once you are over the network, 

956
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:15,380
you are also exposed to attacks. 

957
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:24,200
And this means that because heterogeneity is increasing dramatically, 

958
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:28,970
that the operating system becomes even more important, 

959
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,650
because it's much harder to extract them away. 

960
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,460
Right? 

961
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,220
Because if you don't ask like the way, 

962
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:37,860
it's very hard to write applications, 

963
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:41,820
and the operating system is one of the key roles, like we discussed,

964
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:44,520
is to make that writing developing application very easy. 

965
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:46,890
Right? 

966
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,050
That's why it's operating. 

967
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,290
Some are more challenging, 

968
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,330
are more needed than ever. 

969
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,100
Now, we discussed and they only discussed about specialized hardware.

970
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:02,500
I mentioned that it's not only specialized hardware. 

971
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:10,530
How people try to go around the more slow or kind of so to speak extend

972
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,730
in terms of performance. 

973
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:13,160
In other ways, 

974
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:14,640
are having more and more courts, 

975
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,680
even for general proposed processors, 

976
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,420
like intelligent five that has a processor is 64 course. 

977
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,850
I am the epic, the same 64 course,

978
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:31,050
although there are rumors that the new version will have 128 course. 

979
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:34,620
If you look at these processors, 

980
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:37,830
actually they are them complicated. 

981
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:38,990
Right? 

982
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,230
This is how it looks like. 

983
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:42,290
You have a bunch, 

984
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,740
you have cash, 

985
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:51,440
you have some other components to manage memory. 

986
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:58,800
You have other components here down to can also

987
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:02,920
control the io input output, 

988
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:05,890
getting the data in and out of the processor. 

989
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:10,010
And reading from the memory, 

990
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:12,940
which is not on the cheap, it's off the cheap.

991
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,110
You have also in many systems, 

992
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,310
you have processor, 

993
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,670
you have some integrated graphics. 

994
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,270
Right? 

995
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,060
This is a trend which come and sorry, 

996
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:28,980
if you look under the hood, 

997
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:30,740
they are connected. 

998
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:34,860
It's like mini system in miniature. 

999
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:36,150
Right? 

1000
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:41,280
In this case, you are going to have this is a corpus or car.

1001
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:46,100
Now you are connected to different airports, 

1002
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,610
memory and many other things. 

1003
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,160
And this complexity just increasing. 

1004
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,760
So here down is like it's what we are seeing. 

1005
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:00,000
Here is another trend. 

1006
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:01,690
It's system on a chip, 

1007
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:03,230
right? 

1008
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:08,420
And when going back to that question and apple say, maybe say is more slow,

1009
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:09,180
is not done. 

1010
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:10,260
This is what they do. 

1011
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:14,410
And how they sustain the increasing performance again, 

1012
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:17,380
which is not necessarily later is a morse law, 

1013
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:22,310
is putting more and more intelligence, 

1014
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:26,510
more and more functionality on the same chip. 

1015
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:27,890
Right? 

1016
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:31,810
Here, I will show you have not only cp us,

1017
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:33,730
and the cpu have multiple cores. 

1018
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,000
I'd be sent or eight between six and ten, 

1019
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,800
but you have gps right? 

1020
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:45,240
Integrated on the same chip. 

1021
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,990
You have a core gp us, 

1022
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:48,840
right? 

1023
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:49,800
A core cp us. 

1024
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:51,440
And in addition to that, 

1025
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,740
you have no oral engine, 

1026
01:02:53,010 --> 01:03:01,220
which is really focused on neural to supporting machine learning workloads, 

1027
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,900
the newer land or water blocks. 

1028
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:04,410
Right? 

1029
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,880
This is the things which are like your fingerprint sensor, 

1030
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,580
or recognizing as your face using your face to unlock the phone. 

1031
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:13,180
Right? 

1032
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:13,980
Face recognition. 

1033
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:15,060
Right? 

1034
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:18,380
That's how you are going to get more performance. 

1035
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:24,380
The code is also very complicated, 

1036
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:26,820
is growing in complexity. 

1037
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:28,980
And I don't have the numbers more recent numbers, 

1038
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:31,180
but here is a vista. 

1039
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:36,610
This one15 years ago called it was what? 

1040
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:40,780
50 millions code lines of code is huge complexity. 

1041
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:44,640
Just to give you a sense of nasa space shuttle, 

1042
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:47,490
you remember, it was a space shuttle,

1043
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,170
is no longer in service. 

1044
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:50,500
It has what? 

1045
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,260
I don't know, one of the millions lines of code is crazy.

1046
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:59,760
And then it's, again, like I mentioned several times,

1047
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,640
you have to scale everyone to, 

1048
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:08,010
because you can no longer do these workloads on a single noun, 

1049
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:09,210
on a single machine. 

1050
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:14,460
Like I show you the data for machine learning workloads, 

1051
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:16,500
the same thing is for big data analytics, 

1052
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,380
scientific computing. 

1053
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:22,260
You have so we have several computers which are parallel computers

1054
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:27,580
or indispensable computer since 80s to support this kind of work. 

1055
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:29,470
And then on top of that, 

1056
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,590
everything is connected. 

1057
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:31,620
This is the internet. 

1058
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:35,110
Probably the most and the most impressive artifact. 

1059
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:36,800
The humans have created. 

1060
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:37,670
Right? 

1061
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,590
It links the entire world, 

1062
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:40,610
right? 

1063
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:46,300
And is what you have 4.5 billions people connected to the internet. 

1064
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:47,580
This is what this plot shelves. 

1065
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:48,690
Right? 

1066
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:54,310
And this is what is it happens only25 years. 

1067
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,460
It's quite amazing. 

1068
01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:03,880
And then the smartphone shipments exceeded the pc shipments, 

1069
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:07,550
what I think in200011. 

1070
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:10,230
And today, 

1071
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:19,030
right today actually turns out that you have close to 4

1072
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:24,430
billion smartphones and 5 point something billions mobile phones. 

1073
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:26,240
Right? 

1074
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,040
This data is a little bit old. 

1075
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,650
And all of those all the phones are connected. 

1076
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:33,930
So you have 4 billion, 

1077
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:37,290
this kind of very powerful devices at the end of the day which are connected. 

1078
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,470
You have everything, 

1079
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,990
you have a huge range, right?

1080
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,810
You have everything from data centered with hundreds of thousands

1081
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:51,230
of computers to sends on others, 

1082
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:52,920
right? 

1083
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:55,770
Which you may not be even able to see these chips, 

1084
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:57,000
right? 

1085
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:58,160
And everything in between, 

1086
01:05:59,430 --> 01:05:59,700
right? 

1087
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:01,390
And different or close. 

1088
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:07,040
And just to drive home the.and i'll here. 

1089
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:10,210
So just like I mentioned earlier, 

1090
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,930
many of the applications you are using today, 

1091
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,670
they are distributed, 

1092
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:15,820
right? 

1093
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:17,820
Facebook, twitter, and so forth.

1094
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:21,230
And this is what happens under the hood. 

1095
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:23,000
Right? 

1096
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,140
And let's say you do a simple search, 

1097
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:26,430
right? 

1098
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:30,140
From your android phone or iphone. 

1099
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:30,810
Right? 

1100
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,490
What do you do? 

1101
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,680
So first of all, 

1102
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:38,050
you need to figure out were back and were servers you need to connect, 

1103
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:41,340
to get to send the request, 

1104
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:43,710
your search request, to get the answer.

1105
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,610
In order to do that, 

1106
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:47,140
you need to do this. 

1107
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:49,900
Dns request, domain, name,

1108
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:51,860
salaries. 

1109
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:54,050
Right? 

1110
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:57,880
And it's like you need to resolve use this link, right?

1111
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:00,980
It's google dot com to a particular server. 

1112
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:06,380
You have an entire domain, 

1113
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:10,100
dns infrastructure, 

1114
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,520
which consisting of many servers, 

1115
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,240
they will cooperate to give you an answer, 

1116
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,480
to tell you who you need to connect to, 

1117
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:22,000
who you need to send the pakistan. 

1118
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:24,780
Now, when you get that address,

1119
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:26,280
which is an ip address, 

1120
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,380
you are going to send it over the internet, right?

1121
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:30,580
Over the internet, 

1122
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:35,590
these packets are going to be rooted by switches, routers, and so forth.

1123
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:40,280
And it's going to go based on the ip address, 

1124
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,680
probably in a data center, 

1125
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,640
they are going to learn to a load balancer. 

1126
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,740
The loud balancer, you get the packets you send to a server,

1127
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,020
the web server, 

1128
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:52,160
probably the web server is going to look at the request. 

1129
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:55,270
And based on the request is going to send

1130
01:07:56,380 --> 01:08:00,210
request an entire other disciplinary systems

1131
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:03,080
to resolve that request. 

1132
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:03,920
Right? 

1133
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:05,080
To give you the answers. 

1134
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:06,960
If you have a google inquiry, 

1135
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:12,200
obviously, you may also have to get some ads in the result in the process.

1136
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,310
You have another infrastructure doing only that, 

1137
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:18,050
figuring out what as the shelf. 

1138
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,830
And then you need to put together the entire page and send it

1139
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,350
back and to be displayed on your computer. 

1140
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,110
This is just to give you a sense how complicated things are. 

1141
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:33,950
And all of these interactions are handled by the operating system. 

1142
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:35,690
Right? 

1143
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:36,530
At the lower level. 

1144
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,110
Let me just, 

1145
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,730
we have only 5 minutes. 

1146
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,350
So what i'm going to do, 

1147
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,530
i'm going to do the following thing, 

1148
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:51,330
and we are going to continue next time. 

1149
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:55,720
Let me first try to answer some of the question, 

1150
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:59,250
and then i'm going to go straight to some logistics. 

1151
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,940
How low level does this class get? 

1152
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:12,320
Do it talk about things like pipelining? 

1153
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:16,130
We want to talk much about like pipelining. 

1154
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:20,650
If you are referring as the cpu process in the cpu pipelining, 

1155
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:22,170
like instruction pipelining, 

1156
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:26,590
we are going to talk a little bit about hyper threading. 

1157
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:30,250
We are going to talk about that. 

1158
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,430
We'll answer. 

1159
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,270
This is about hyper threading. 

1160
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,110
We are going to talk more about being short. 

1161
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,780
It's a way in which you can share the core, 

1162
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,700
one core between two threads, 

1163
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:45,760
which can be come from different applications. 

1164
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,310
So it's multiplexing one core. 

1165
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:55,040
So let me just skip, 

1166
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:56,400
and obviously, 

1167
01:09:56,410 --> 01:10:04,090
we'll do that as next time and talk a little bit here, 

1168
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:15,590
more about the class syllabus. 

1169
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,230
And it's online. 

1170
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,390
You have the class. 

1171
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,600
So we are going to, obviously,

1172
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:28,220
to learn the operating system concepts and how a system programmer

1173
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,290
is going to use these concepts. 

1174
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,150
What are the interfaces? 

1175
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,230
Ap is? 

1176
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:38,600
Then we are going to learn about how the operating system implements a lot

1177
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:39,840
some of this functionality. 

1178
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:42,720
Like how is going to manage concurrency, 

1179
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:44,870
multiple applications, 

1180
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,910
accessing share resources at the same time, 

1181
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:48,910
address space, 

1182
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,080
how you are going to provide isolation between different applications. 

1183
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:59,830
So that each one application or process will not step over the memory

1184
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,750
of another application or process. 

1185
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:03,280
File systems, 

1186
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:09,030
how you are going to access and store the data and retrieve the data, 

1187
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,860
send the data and receive the data over the network. 

1188
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:18,110
We are going to talk a little bit about disability systems

1189
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:22,960
and the protocols which are and the mechanics which are implemented

1190
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:30,340
by the distributed systems to make them easier to use and to be more

1191
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:30,980
efficient. 

1192
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,980
And we are going to talk about reliability and security for tolerance, 

1193
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:37,060
protection, and so forth.

1194
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,110
Finally, 

1195
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,470
we are going to talk about a little bit about cloud infrastructure, 

1196
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,430
which is very relevant, because right now,

1197
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,190
cloud is the effect of standard. 

1198
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,350
You are going to. 

1199
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,780
Many companies are building, 

1200
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:52,140
especially startups are building their application. 

1201
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:56,560
This class is hands on. 

1202
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,730
You are going to learn by doing. 

1203
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:04,240
You have a bunch of homeworks and projects are extremely important. 

1204
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:07,640
And with the projects you are going to implement, 

1205
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:09,000
actually also in the homework, 

1206
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:13,490
some mechanism, some functionality that operating system,

1207
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:19,220
though I like your strength and scheduling file systems, 

1208
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:21,710
and so forth, memory allocation.

1209
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:23,390
This will be very exciting. 

1210
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:28,250
Now, what are the demands?

1211
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,890
The project will require you to be

1212
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:34,980
very comfortable with programming and debugging c so remember, 

1213
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:36,260
recall pointers, 

1214
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:37,380
memory management, 

1215
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,680
use gdp for debugging. 

1216
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:46,360
So just go over 61 c again, 

1217
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:54,460
you need to know how to use git for version control. 

1218
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,270
There is ac programming reference here if you need. 

1219
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,560
So please consult that. 

1220
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,200
I think the first section are dedicated to programming and debugging reviews. 

1221
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:11,650
So please attend these sections. 

1222
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:14,480
You can attend it to section, I believe,

1223
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:16,120
for the first 2 weeks after that, 

1224
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,880
you need to choose one session a section. 

1225
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:24,330
The other thing I want to say and to be quite quick here, 

1226
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:31,150
but also I want to emphasize that projects are very important, 

1227
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:34,430
and projects are not only about doing a piece of software and building

1228
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,350
a piece of software, 

1229
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,340
but project about teaching you how to collaborate, 

1230
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:39,840
how to work in a team. 

1231
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,880
This will be extremely important for you. 

1232
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:46,830
If you go and to join to be a software engineer, 

1233
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,030
this is a key skill you need to learn. 

1234
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:52,410
You are going to learn to do to work in a team. 

1235
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,410
You need to make the team successful, 

1236
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:56,890
because that's that's how you are going to become successful. 

1237
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:59,020
You are not going to work alone. 

1238
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,840
We require the project to have four members, 

1239
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:06,390
never five. 

1240
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:11,930
The exception will be very rare. 

1241
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:14,380
Please, this is pandemic.

1242
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:16,660
Still, pandemic is very hard, more active.

1243
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:18,580
Most of the activities will be online. 

1244
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:20,850
If you do online, 

1245
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:22,710
turn the camera on, 

1246
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:26,070
try to emulate the physical presence as much as possible. 

1247
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,280
But also now you can also the campus is open. 

1248
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,100
Right? 

1249
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,870
If you feel comfortable, 

1250
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,390
you can go and meet in paris. 

1251
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:34,380
Right? 

1252
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,730
But collaborate, 

1253
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:37,940
right? 

1254
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:39,610
And also not only between yours, 

1255
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:42,130
your man, you and your members of team,

1256
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:44,820
but also your da right? 

1257
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:48,930
Over communication is how you make this project successful. 

1258
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,660
Then you need to devise the work among the members of the team, 

1259
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:55,760
right? 

1260
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:58,530
To require both decision and additional collaboration, 

1261
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:04,770
because every you are going to depend on the work of other people in your team. 

1262
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:07,130
This is a grading. 

1263
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:10,840
36% is for 3 meters. 

1264
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:12,000
We have only meters. 

1265
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:12,960
Now, final,

1266
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:15,390
36% projects, 

1267
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,470
80% homeworks, 

1268
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,460
10% participation, section, lectures, and so forth.

1269
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:25,000
You'll hear more about the project. 

1270
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:26,520
You have a design document. 

1271
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:28,110
Design document will be due. 

1272
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,970
You are going to get feedback from the t as and so forth. 

1273
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:33,960
Books and infrastructures, 

1274
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:39,430
you should be able to find all the Information as a class web page. 

1275
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,490
There is a piazza. 

1276
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,650
You find the link to the piazza as well. 

1277
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,890
There the lectures will be recorded. 

1278
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,970
Sorry, about today,

1279
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,690
about the beginning of the lecture. 

1280
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:54,130
The textbook is the operating system principles and practice

1281
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:57,690
from Tom Anderson and Tom Anderson and Mike darling. 

1282
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:01,940
There are a few other books, very good,

1283
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:06,080
and you are encouraged to consult and to, 

1284
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:09,060
you can refer to. 

1285
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,460
And we are going to have a few supplemental materials, 

1286
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:14,930
a few research papers, and so forth.

1287
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:15,690
We are going to let. 

1288
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:18,660
Finally, 

1289
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:21,280
Lee's is like, 

1290
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:23,840
this is not no joke. 

1291
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:25,190
Personal integrity. 

1292
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,880
You sign there used to be academic honor code. 

1293
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,580
So please leave by it. 

1294
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,630
You can explain the concept of other people in the group. 

1295
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,190
You can discuss the concept with other people on the group. 

1296
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,590
You can even help your friend to debug your code, the code,

1297
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:47,960
or you can search online for generic codes. 

1298
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:49,670
This is no good, 

1299
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,710
but you cannot share the code with other groups. 

1300
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:57,950
You cannot copy or read another group's code or best cases. 

1301
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:05,540
You cannot call to copy or reading online code or test cases from prior years. 

1302
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:12,950
And we are going that we compare all projects submission against priority

1303
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,530
of emissions and online solutions

1304
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:18,630
and will take actions right against your friend. 

1305
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,790
So please don't do that. 

1306
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:27,260
Is not going to help you to with learning. 

1307
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:30,070
That's probably the most important reason you shouldn't do it. 

1308
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:34,950
Let's try hard to make this class in to keep this class interactive. 

1309
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:37,760
I'm going to stop here. 

1310
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:40,560
I'm going to take it about the talker. 

1311
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:41,080
Obviously, 

1312
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:44,640
a little bit more about the operating system general overview next time. 

1313
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:49,090
Now let me answer the questions which are still here. 

1314
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,670
How there are two other questions. 

1315
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,670
There is actually one last question. 

1316
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:01,690
Would it be good to review material of the later half of six times c

1317
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:06,110
like absolutely components of the CPU how much of this? 

1318
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:06,730
Absolutely? 

1319
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:08,020
This would be very useful? 

1320
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,160
We are going to talk about cashing. 

1321
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:12,590
We are going to talk and reviewing that. 

1322
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,650
It will be so useful. 

1323
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:19,210
How does a participation grading work? 

1324
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:27,440
This will be mostly because it will be a more smaller groups from interacting

1325
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:30,520
with your t as office hours and discussions, 

1326
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:31,640
discussion sections. 

1327
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,090
I am at the size of this class. 

1328
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:39,050
I don't think I will have the opportunity to interact with many of you, 

1329
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:40,610
especially since we are remote. 

1330
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:44,190
But obviously, if you have any problem, anything,

1331
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,150
please do not hesitate to drop me an EMAIL. 

1332
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,850
And you can look for me, 

1333
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:53,060
i'll be in a soda hall, 

1334
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:54,420
at least now and then. 

1335
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:58,580
Thank you so much, everyone.

1336
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:02,220
And i'll see you next Tuesday. 

1337
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:06,480
If you have any other questions, 

1338
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:08,280
please ask the questions. 

1339
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:13,000
If you also have any other suggestions about how to make the class better? 

1340
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:16,830
More interactive, please don't know how to hesitate to let us know.

1341
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:20,190
It's again, II the first time I'm using is a seminar,

1342
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:28,040
a it's hard to just talk at the screen and see the slide, 

1343
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:30,420
not see any of your faces. 

1344
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:36,920
But let's try to do our best and any idea. 

1345
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:40,900
You see, you have to improve interactivity to improve the class.

1346
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:42,650
In general, let us know.

1347
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:43,360
Thank you.
