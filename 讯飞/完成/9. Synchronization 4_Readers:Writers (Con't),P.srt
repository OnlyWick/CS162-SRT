1
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,330
Hello, everyone.
大家好。

2
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,420
So welcome to the nice lecture.
欢迎来到这个精彩的讲座。

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,570
This lecture, it's the content of this lecture.
这节课，是关于这节课的内容。

4
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,910
It's included in your first meter.
这已经包含在您的第一个计量单位中。

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,910
That's quite important.
这非常重要。

6
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,490
It's also a very important lecture for your future homeworks and projects.
这也是对你未来的作业和项目非常重要的一堂课。

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,140
So,
所以，

8
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:51,580
and we are going to continue our discussion about abstraction to implement critical
我们将继续讨论关于实现关键抽象的问题。

9
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,940
sections and synchronization between processes.
进程间的分段和同步。

10
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,810
If you remember,
如果你还记得的话，

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,490
last time we discussed that one of the main abstraction,
上次我们讨论了一个主要的抽象概念，

12
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,690
which it makes it easier to implement critical sections,
这使得实现临界区更加容易。

13
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,330
exclusion from critical sections.
临界区的排除

14
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,730
So only one thread it should be active in a critical section
在关键区域中只能有一个线程处于活动状态。

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,330
at a given time or locks.
在给定的时间或锁定状态下。

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,540
And we discuss the implementation of locks using interrupts.
我们讨论了使用中断实现锁的方法。

17
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:25,810
And then we said there are some disadvantages of using interacts and some dangers.
然后我们说使用交互式界面存在一些缺点和一些危险性。

18
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,080
And then we discuss about,
然后我们讨论关于...

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,700
then using atomic operation,
然后使用原子操作，

20
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:41,030
which are more sophisticated than load and store to implement these locks.
相比于加载和存储操作，有更复杂的方法来实现这些锁。

21
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,490
And one of them,
其中之一，

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,090
it will be like best and set.
它将会像最好和设置一样。

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,630
I if you remember,
如果你还记得的话，

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,910
is a test and set,
是一个测试和设置操作。

25
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:55,900
it's takes a value
它接受一个值。

26
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,440
and maintains a local variable.
并且维护一个本地变量。

27
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,370
Think about distance that maintains a local variable.
考虑一下维持局部变量的距离。

28
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,850
The atomic operation is that taking a value,
原子操作是指获取一个值，

29
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,140
updating the local variable is a new value,
更新本地变量为一个新值。

30
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,600
and then returning the previous value of the local variable.
然后返回局部变量的先前值。

31
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,050
That's pretty much.
就是这样。

32
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,490
This is and implementation.
这是一个实现。

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:32,160
Again, we discussed last time of a lock acquire and lock release and
上次我们讨论了锁的获取和释放问题，

34
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,160
using test and set,
使用测试和设置（test and set）操作，

35
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:43,370
and basically use test and set here also to implement mutual
在这里，基本上也可以使用测试和设置来实现互斥。

36
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:51,380
exclusion are of operating of the is the value of the lock.
互斥是操作系统中锁的一个重要属性。

37
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,510
The lock,
锁定，

38
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,820
value of the lock, which whereas is busy or free,
锁的值，无论是忙碌还是空闲，

39
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,560
determine whether you can enter or not in the critical section
确定你是否可以进入临界区

40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,550
of the program of the user.
用户程序的功能。

41
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,590
Now we have a second,
现在我们有第二个

42
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,910
we use test and set for a second smaller critical section,
我们使用测试并设置（test and set）来实现一个较小的临界区。

43
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,440
which is only concern of updating the lock value to be your free.
这只涉及将锁的值更新为可用的问题。

44
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,770
If you remember,
如果你还记得的话，

45
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,000
all these synchronization primitives involves weight,
所有这些同步原语都涉及到权重。

46
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,050
the reason for that is because it's fundamental because if you have
这是因为这是基本的原因，如果你有的话。

47
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,780
two threads which wants to enter in the same critical section,
两个线程想要进入同一个临界区

48
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,830
you can only allow one thread to enter in the critical section.
你只允许一个线程进入临界区。

49
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,320
Therefore, the other thread has nothing else to do,
因此，另一个线程没有其他事情要做。

50
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,460
but wait for the first step to finish.
但是请等待第一步完成。

51
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,440
So that's why waiting is fundamental.
这就是为什么等待是基本的。

52
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,620
Okay?
好的？

53
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,190
The other thing you remember,
你还记得的另一件事是，

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,270
if you wait one way to wait,
如果你等待一种方式来等待，

55
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,240
it's easy to implement the still busy waiting.
实现静态忙等待很容易。

56
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,550
You constantly check whether the critical section is free,
你不断地检查临界区是否空闲，

57
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,590
whether you can acquire the lock.
你是否能够获取锁。

58
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:20,750
But this consumes the cpu cycles without doing any useful work.
但这样会消耗 CPU 周期而没有做任何有用的工作。

59
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,740
So therefore,
因此，

60
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,420
waiting, what you want to invent,
等待中，你想要发明什么？

61
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,940
the best way to implement,
最佳实现方式是，

62
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,160
waiting and the preferred way is to go to sleep,
等待的最佳方式是进入睡眠状态，

63
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,600
to put the thread when the waiting queue,
将线程放入等待队列中

64
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,510
and then to be open up when there are the previous thread exceeds
当前线程超过之前的线程时，就会打开。

65
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,430
the critical section.
临界区。

66
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,340
Okay?
好的？

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,030
This is what you see here.
这是你在这里看到的。

68
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,150
If the value is busy,
如果值忙碌，

69
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,370
if someone acquired a lock and has acquired a locker in the critical section,
如果有人获取了一个锁，并且在临界区中获取了一个储物柜，

70
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,980
you put the thread on the weight queue,
你将线程放入了权重队列中。

71
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,620
and then you go to sleep,
然后你去睡觉，

72
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,700
and then you reset this card, which is, again,
然后你重新设置这张卡片，这又是

73
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,140
this card it's about.
这张卡片是关于什么的。

74
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:09,640
It's basically you freeze a lock for the critical section,
这基本上是将一个锁冻结以保护临界区。

75
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,760
which is concerned with updating the busy value.
这个问题涉及到更新繁忙值。

76
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,690
As it's the value is busy,
由于该值正忙，请稍后再试。

77
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,860
you set the value to be,
你将值设置为，

78
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,220
this requires a lock,
这需要一个锁。

79
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,950
then you again, said,
那么你又说，

80
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,270
go out to zero.
出发前往零点。

81
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:37,430
So that for you are going to allow another thread to look,
所以你要允许另一个线程来查看

82
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,970
tend to read the log value and modify it.
倾向于读取日志值并进行修改。

83
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,380
Any questions here?
这里有什么问题吗？

84
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,700
So not, again, that we have the same discussion.
所以，不要再次讨论这个问题了。

85
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,940
We have the same discussion like in the in the case of when using interrupt
我们的讨论与在使用中断时的情况类似。

86
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,370
to implement the choir and release.
实现合唱和发布。

87
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,870
And that is is when we are going to set the guard to zero,
这就是我们要将警卫设置为零的时候，

88
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,030
there is one you are going to disable the interact.
你要禁用交互的一个功能。

89
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,490
And this needs to be done.
这个需要完成。

90
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,440
You cannot do before sleep,
睡觉前不能做。

91
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,240
you cannot do before the thread on weight queue.
在权重队列上的线程之前，你不能这样做。

92
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,080
Just remember.
请记住。

93
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:22,950
Why is that?
为什么这样做呢？

94
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,840
You can look at the last lecture.
你可以查看上一堂课的讲义。

95
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,440
So you need to do, in some sense, after,
在某种意义上，你需要在之后做一些事情。

96
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,140
but then after the thread itself,
但在线程本身之后，

97
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,620
which call acquire cannot do it because it's sleeping.
由于它正在休眠，调用acquire无法执行。

98
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,340
So that has to be done either by the operating system or by the next trend,
这要么由操作系统完成，要么由下一个趋势完成。

99
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,510
which is going to be scheduled to reset the guard.
将被安排重置警卫。

100
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:45,740
Okay?
好的？

101
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,350
Here it's a simple example.
这是一个简单的例子。

102
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,330
This is a great question.
这是一个很好的问题。

103
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,980
So one question here, it was a the guard and value will be on the hip.
这里有一个问题，它是关于警卫和价值物品放在腰间的。

104
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,830
They are going to be on.
它们即将开启。

105
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,870
They're going to be a global variables,
它们将成为全局变量。

106
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,810
so everyone can access them.
这样每个人都可以访问它们。

107
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,070
Now,
现在，

108
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,000
we've seen two implementation is actually of acquire and release locks.
我们已经看到了两种实现实际上是获取和释放锁的方式。

109
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,560
One is using interacts,
一种方法是使用交互式操作。

110
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,600
and the other one using test and set.
另一个方法使用测试和设置。

111
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,930
And this basically shows is to show you that actually the logic is very,
这基本上是要向您展示的是实际上逻辑非常简单，

112
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,650
very similar.
非常相似。

113
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,950
And you can think about while test and set,
你可以在测试和设置时考虑一下，

114
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,860
it's similarly disabled interrupts and enabling and guard a reseting guard
类似地，禁用中断并启用和保护复位保护。

115
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,480
to zero is like enabling the interacts.
将其归零就像启用交互功能。

116
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:05,310
This is against the code for we went over last lecture about implementing,
这违反了我们上一堂关于实现的课程中讲到的规范。

117
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,950
acquire,
获取、获得、取得

118
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,700
and release by disabling and enabling the internet.
通过禁用和启用互联网来释放。

119
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,190
And if you remember,
如果你还记得的话，

120
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,110
also what they did last time,
还有上次他们做了什么？

121
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,830
when we talk about locks we did in two stages.
当我们谈论锁时，我们分为两个阶段进行。

122
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:20,990
First of all,
首先，

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,830
we said we gave this very trivial implementation of the locks acquire.
我们说过我们给出了这个非常简单的锁获取的实现。

124
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,660
You disable the interrupts,
你禁用了中断。

125
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,860
why it is able to interrupt,
为什么它能够中断？

126
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,960
because you don't want new new threats to interrupt you, right?
因为你不想让新的威胁打断你，对吗？

127
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,020
While you are in the critical section, right?
你是指在临界区域内吗？

128
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,920
And then the release is enabling the internet.
然后发布将使互联网变得可用。

129
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:45,340
But this was very dangerous because if you call as the user level,
但这样做非常危险，因为如果你在用户级别下调用，

130
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,220
acquiring, disable, interrupts,
获取，禁用，中断

131
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,240
and you have a very long critical section or you make mistakes and you have
一个很长的临界区或者你犯了错误，并且你有

132
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,400
an infinite while loop in the critical section.
在临界区中有一个无限循环。

133
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,460
Then your computer will hack.
那么你的计算机将被黑客攻击。

134
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,690
You can do anything about.
你可以对此事做任何事情。

135
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,830
The only thing probably is power off power on.
可能的唯一解决办法就是关机重启。

136
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:02,980
Right?
对吗？

137
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,020
So therefore,
因此，

138
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,170
is a more sophisticated implementation was to use disable and enable
更复杂的实现方式是使用禁用和启用。

139
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,160
interrupts only for updating the value of the lock.
中断仅用于更新锁的值。

140
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,080
Now you have a value of the lock which set to zero and you disable
现在你有一个值为零的锁，并且你已经禁用了它。

141
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,000
and enable interrupts to update that value,
并启用中断来更新该值，

142
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,650
right?
对的？

143
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,810
Or to leave that value.

144
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,920
Now you still use disable and enable interacts.
现在你仍然使用禁用和启用交互。

145
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,000
But now it's very short.

147
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:36,980

148
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,930
If you look,
如果你看一下，

149
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,230
again, if you look now at the same example,

150
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,950
but now implementing, acquire, and release,

151
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,150
using test and set,

152
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,480
we went again through two iterations.

153
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,400
The first iteration was very simple that while distance set values,

154
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,520
you are doing the values, a lot of value.

155
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,350
While this is why the value is one.

156
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,660
Right?

162
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,410
If it's the previous one was zero, returned,
如果前一个是零，则返回。

163
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,010
zero means there's a lock.
zero 表示有锁。

164
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,650
It's acquired.

172
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,080
But it's, again, the problem is this one,

173
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,220
and the release is simply set the value to zero.

174
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,340

00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,050
it's we,
这是我们。

277
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,740
as humans are not very used about handling many things which happen
由于人类并不习惯处理许多事情的发生

278
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,660
at the same time.
同时。

279
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:19,290
We had much better in equalizing sequentializing things.
我们在使事物变得相等和顺序化方面做得更好。

280
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,860
So it's perfectly fine.
所以这是完全没问题的。

281
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,250
I if you feel this is a little bit more challenging,
如果你觉得这有点更具挑战性，

282
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,580
but at the same time,
但与此同时，

283
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,340
this also means that you should spend a little bit more time
这也意味着你应该多花一点时间。

284
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,500
to try to understand deeply what's happening here.
努力深入理解这里发生的事情。

285
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,610
Again, some languages provide monitors.
再次强调，一些编程语言提供了监视器。

286
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,410
And let's see what is conditional variables,
让我们来看看什么是条件变量。

287
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,970
conditional variables,
条件变量

288
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,490
what is a conditional variable?
条件变量是一种在多线程编程中使用的同步机制。它允许线程在满足特定条件之前等待，并在条件满足时被唤醒。条件变量通常与互斥锁一起使用，以确保线程在访问共享资源之前等待正确的条件。当条件不满足时，线程会进入等待状态，释放互斥锁，直到其他线程通过唤醒操作通知条件变量满足条件为止。一旦条件满足，线程会重新获得互斥锁，并继续执行。条件变量的使用可以有效地避免线程的忙等待，提高多线程程序的效率。

289
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,390
It's a queue of threads waiting for something inside a critical section to happen.
这是一个等待在关键区域内某些事件发生的线程队列。

290
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:09,040
And the nice thing about the critical section send the conditional,
关于临界区和条件发送的好处是，

291
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:09,760
sorry,
对不起，

292
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:16,210
and I think about the monitors and conditional variables is conditional variables,
我认为你在谈论监视器和条件变量，其中条件变量是一种条件变量。

293
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,480
allow sleeping inside the critical section by atomically,
通过原子操作允许在临界区内休眠。

294
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,000
releasing the lock at a time regardlessly.
无论何时都会释放锁定。

295
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,180
So what I mean by that,
所以我的意思是，

296
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,810
here is what I mean.
这是我的意思。

297
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,670
Remember about this slide?
还记得这张幻灯片吗？

298
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,020
I'll go soon in again in presentation mode.
我很快会再次进入演示模式。

299
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,330
Here,
在这里，

300
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,060
it's a game.
这是一个游戏。

301
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,570
If you try to acquire the lock,
如果你尝试获取锁定，

302
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,250
and the lock is busy,
锁已被占用，

303
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,610
so the value is one.
所以这个值是一。

304
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,930
You have to go to sleep.
你必须去睡觉。

305
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,250
And what you want,
你想要什么？

306
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,640
we want this,
我们想要这个。

307
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:59,610
how we want this to happen is to put the thread in the waiting queue.
我们希望的做法是将线程放入等待队列中。

308
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,100
But when you put the set of the waiting queue,
但是当你将等待队列的集合放入时，

309
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:09,950
you need also to really to resell the guard To let other threads.
你还需要确保重新放置守卫，以允许其他线程进入。

310
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,220
And there is a critical section to look at the value,
并且有一个关键部分需要查看该值，

311
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,110
maybe to modify the value.
可能是为了修改这个值。

312
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,970
So now the sleep and the guard have to happen at the same time.
现在，睡眠和保护必须同时发生。

313
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,550
Okay?
好的？

314
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:31,730
They need to be atomic and monitors,
它们需要是原子操作和监视器。

315
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,450
provide and conditional variables for monitors.
为监视器提供条件变量和条件变量。

条件变量是一种同步机制，用于在多个线程之间进行通信和协调。它们通常与锁结合使用，以确保线程在满足特定条件之前等待，并在条件满足时被唤醒。

在监视器中，条件变量用于在共享资源的状态发生变化时通知等待线程。它们允许线程在等待条件满足时进入休眠状态，并在条件满足时被唤醒。

提供变量用于监视器的实现。它们用于控制对共享资源的访问，并确保线程按照特定的顺序执行。提供变量通常与锁结合使用，以确保线程在访问共享资源之前获取锁，并在完成后释放锁。

通过使用条件变量和提供变量，可以实现线程之间的协调和同步，以避免竞争条件和死锁等问题。这些机制是操作系统中重要的工具，用于实现并发和并行程序的正确性和效率。

316
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:42,120
Provide you this atomicity between the threads going to sleep and giving
确保线程进入睡眠和释放之间的原子性

317
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,360
up releasing the lock,
释放锁

318
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:50,280
because it's equally zero release a clock associated with a guard atomically.
因为它等于零，所以原子地释放与保护原子关联的时钟。

319
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,090
You don't need to worry about that.
你不需要担心那个。

320
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,520
That's what conditional variables in monitors are going to do for you.
这就是在监视器中使用条件变量所能为你做的事情。

321
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,310
And that's why they are very useful.
这就是为什么它们非常有用。

322
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,630
Here are the operations,
以下是操作列表：

323
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,310
the operation you wait for the lock,

324
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:21,700
which I thought you can you can automatically,

325
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,860
this is going to,

326
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,940
the operation is going to automatically leads a lock and go to sleep.

327
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,150
You can acquire the lock like that.
你可以这样获取锁。

328
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:36,920
Will also have a few examples to make it more understandable.
还会有一些例子，以使其更易理解。

329
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,340
Then you have signals.
然后你有信号。

330
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:43,700
You remember that one of the use of the summer force was to signal when one,

It really is a lock.
这真的是一个锁。

384
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,470
You have a buffer lock,
你有一个缓冲区锁。

385
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,390
and the consumer also acquired the lock and release a lock.
消费者也获得了锁并释放了锁。

386
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,050
Right?
对吗？

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,190
This is in order to protect the critical sections which are operating
这是为了保护正在运行的临界区。

388
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,710
on the queue.

391
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,820
at the same time.
同时。

392
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,620
Because inserting adding a new element to the queue,
因为要向队列中插入一个新元素，

393
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,580
removing an element from the queue are not atomic operations.
从队列中移除一个元素不是原子操作。

394
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:44,290
Therefore,
因此，

395
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,060
bad things can happen while you both of them are manipulating the pointers,

396
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:49,940
right?
对的？

397
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,500
To insert or remove the element from the queue.
向队列中插入或移除元素。

398
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,430
Now, you need to you,
现在，你需要你自己。

399
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:03,760
you can use these conditioned variables like buff cv
你可以像使用 buff cv 一样使用这些条件变量。

400
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,130
in order to signal the producer.
为了通知生产者。

401
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,770
That's basically what says.
基本上就是这样说的。

402
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,230
The buff cv is a signal,
缓冲区（buff）是一种信号。

403
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:17,700
a is a way for the producer to signal the consumer that there are elements
a 是生产者向消费者发出信号，表示有元素可用。

404
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,720
in the buffer in the queue.
在队列中的缓冲区中。

405
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,580
This is what it is, your signal.
这就是它，你的信号。

406
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:31,430
It what do you do from in the consumer?
你在消费者中做什么工作？

407
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,290
While it's empty?
在它是空的时候吗？

408
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,630
So you look for the cure as it's empty.
所以你正在寻找治愈，因为它是空的。

409
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,010
Right?
对吗？

410
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,330
It's in the critical section,
它处于临界区。

411
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,290
so it's far as fair to look at the queue,
所以看待队列是公平的。

412
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,930
because no one else will modify the queue while you are
因为在你操作队列时，没有其他人会对其进行修改。

413
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,610
in the critical section to operate on the queue.
在临界区操作队列。

414
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,480
And then you call this condition, wait.
然后你将这个条件称为等待。

415
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,240
So you're waiting for this signal for the best subsidy.
所以你正在等待这个信号来获得最佳的补贴。

416
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,880
And you also, you see,
而且你也明白，

417
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,360
this is the first argument of condition weight.
这是条件权重的第一个参数。

418
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,530
And the second argument in buffalo, why is that?
在buffalo中的第二个参数是为什么？

419
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,080
Because if the queue is empty,
因为如果队列为空，

420
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,410
this is true.
这是真的。

421
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,570
This in condition wait.
这是一个条件等待。

422
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,890
And but what you are going to do is basically you are going to put
但是你要做的基本上是将其放置

423
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,890
the threat to sleep,
对睡眠的威胁

424
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,360
and you need to release a lock.
你需要释放一个锁。

425
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,380
Right?
对吗？

426
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:23,660
This basically tells the condition wait to release the lock once the thread
这基本上告诉条件等待在线程完成后释放锁。

427
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,460
is going to sleep.
正在去睡觉。

428
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,580
Remember,
记住，

429
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,360
we want here to have atomic operation.
我们希望这里进行原子操作。

430
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,140
The slip, these things above it should be an atomic operation.
滑动操作，其上的这些事情应该是一个原子操作。

431
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,640
Aaron,
亲爱的亚伦，

432
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,040
it has a question here.
这里有一个问题。

433
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,940
If you use a broadcast,
如果你使用广播，

434
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,330
it will create a race condition.
这将会产生竞态条件。

435
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,470
Not necessary.
不必要的。

436
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,590
We'll see that in an example.
我们将在一个例子中看到这一点。

437
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,120
Right?
对吗？

438
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,280
Because still,
因为仍然，

439
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:01,280
not all you can wake up all the waiters,
并不是所有的服务员都能被叫醒。

440
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,730
but only if all the waiters want to go to the same critical section,
但前提是所有的服务员都想进入同一个临界区。

441
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,330
still only one will succeed.
仍然只有一个人会成功。

442
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:08,610
Okay?
好的？

443
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,160
And the other one will go back to wait.
另一个将返回等待状态。

444
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,550
So you you are still going to be, okay.
所以你还会继续做，好的。

445
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,990
Sorry.
抱歉。

446
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,400
So this is basically what happened here.
所以基本上就是发生了这样的事情。

447
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,080
Now, and I think this was a question last time.
现在，我记得上次也是这个问题。

448
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,820
I don't remember who has that question.
我不记得谁有那个问题了。

449
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,540
It was a great question about what you remember.
这是一个很好的问题，关于你记得什么。

450
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,900
If you go to,
如果你去到，

451
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,400
I think, was in the context of test onset,
我认为，在测试开始的背景下，

452
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:48,110
why do you use while and not if it's a similar thing here,
为什么在这里使用 while 而不是 if，它们的作用类似。

453
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,350
and we'll explain why.
我们将解释原因。

454
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,020
And what is the difference.
这是什么区别呢？

455
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:55,670
And the problem here is that if you look at this piece of code,
问题在于，如果你看一下这段代码，

456
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,370
will you just the consumer wait for the queue to be non empty to have elements?
作为消费者，您是否会等待队列非空才能获取元素？

457
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,990
In order to be queue?
为了成为队列？

458
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,950
A new element from the queue?
队列中的一个新元素？

459
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,450
It has a wire.

460
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,170
Right?
对吗？

461
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,890
And the natural question you can ask, look, why?
而且你可以问的自然问题是，看，为什么呢？

462
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,440
Because the thread is going to sleep, right?
因为线程要进入休眠状态，对吗？

463
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,820
So why do you do that?
那么你为什么这样做呢？

464
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,920
And it's true that it's a good question.
这是一个好问题，而且是真的。

465
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,200
Let me start with that.
让我从那个开始。

466
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,060
You see that why should I do the while?
你看到为什么我要做这个循环呢？

467
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,470
Because again,

468
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,070
it's like the study is going to sleep,
就好像学习要进入休眠状态一样，

469
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,580
and it's going to be open up if another thread exceeds the critical section.
如果另一个线程超过了临界区域，它将被打开。

470
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,590
Right?
对吗？

471
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,390
So I should test again.

472
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:50,110
The answer here is that it depends on the implementation.

you can use if the first one in which requires you to have to save while,
你可以使用第一个选项，它要求你在保存时使用 while 循环。

482
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,390
is called messer style,

483
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:21,570

00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,910
is going to schedule the thread,
将要调度线程

548
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,640
which is now in the radical,
现在处于激进派的是哪一个？

549
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,310
sometimes later.
稍后一些时候。

550
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,750
But you see now,
但是你现在看到了，

551
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:25,210
so what is but we see now that now you need to check this condition, again,
所以现在我们看到你需要再次检查这个条件。

552
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,400
is mpq why?
mpq 是什么？

553
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,460
Because in the meantime,
因为与此同时，

554
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,580
there can be another between,
之间可能还有另一个。

555
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,580
in the meantime,
与此同时，

556
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,900
you can have a race condition.
你可能会遇到竞态条件。

557
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:40,370
And another thread comes and wants to acquire acquires a lock,
另一个线程来了并想要获取一个锁，

558
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,570
because it's free.
因为它是免费的。

559
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:46,410
And now, you are going to have two threads on this,
现在，你将在这个上面有两个线程。

560
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,270
which are on the ridicule,
这些都是荒谬可笑的。

561
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,060
which one to enter is the same critical section.
进入哪个临界区是相同的。

562
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,410
So that is not good.
那样不好。

563
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,070
Right?
对吗？

564
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,080
So that's kind of the problem,
所以这就是问题所在，

565
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,000
right?
是的，正确的。

566
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:01,320
That's not.
那不是。

567
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,140
But by doing so,
但是这样做的话，

568
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,770
you are going to have less context switches, right?
你将会减少上下文切换，对吗？

569
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,650
In this case.
在这种情况下。

570
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,360
Right?
对吗？

571
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:13,670
You have the first thread finishes exceeding the critical section.
你有第一个线程完成超过临界区。

572
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,120
Then you are going to,
那么你将要，

573
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:20,690
after that, you are going to execute the second set.
之后，你将执行第二组。

574
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,890
So it's one context switch.
所以这是一次上下文切换。

575
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,210
In the previous case,
在之前的情况下，

576
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,570
you have one context switch,
你有一个上下文切换。

577
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,680
going from the signaling thread to the thread which is writing and back.
从信号线程切换到正在写入的线程，然后再切换回来。

578
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,550
So at least you have to.
所以至少你必须这样做。

579
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,300
Right?
对吗？

580
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:38,870
Okay.
好的。

581
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,160
Any questions?
有任何问题吗？

582
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:49,060
Let's not look now at our buffer,
现在先不要看我们的缓冲区，

583
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:58,330
q example and use a more.
请提供一个例子并提供更多的用途。

584
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,730
And now we are using,
现在我们正在使用的是，

585
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:08,920
we are using two conditioned variables for producer and the consumer.
我们正在使用两个条件变量来控制生产者和消费者。

586
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,200
Let me give you the code.
让我给你提供代码。

587
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,540
We are also looking now is bounded buffer.
我们现在也在看有界缓冲区。

588
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,060
So in previous case,
在之前的情况中，

589
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,940
we use only unconditioned variable that it was unbounded buffer,
我们只使用了一个无条件的变量，它是一个无界缓冲区。

590
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,550
infinite buffer size.
无限缓冲区大小。

591
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,030
Here is bounded.
这是有界的。

592
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,570
How do you have two variables?
你如何拥有两个变量？

593
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,650
You can check whether the buffer is full or empty.
你可以检查缓冲区是否满或空。

594
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,340
And then,
然后，

595
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:40,090
if the buffer is full, while the buffer is full, obviously,
如果缓冲区已满，当缓冲区已满时，显然，

596
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,570
the producer weights.
生产者的权重。

597
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:49,090
Otherwise, you incur an item in the buffer and you signal the consumer.
否则，你会在缓冲区中添加一个项目，并通知消费者。

598
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:54,230
Because now the buffer is no longer empty,
因为现在缓冲区不再为空，

599
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,430
and the consumer can drain,
而消费者可以消耗能量，

600
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,680
can take that element from the buffer.
可以从缓冲区中取出该元素。

601
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,100
The consumer is the same.
消费者是相同的。

602
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,660
If the buffer was,
如果缓冲区是这样的，

603
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,820
if the buffer, if it's empty,
如果缓冲区为空，

604
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,230
you can do anything.
你可以做任何事情。

605
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,310
There is no item you can take from the buffer.
缓冲区中没有可以取出的项目。

606
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,070
If the buffer is not empty,
如果缓冲区不为空，

607
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,850
you decue it and you signal a producer,
你解除它并向生产者发送信号。

608
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,370
then there is at least one free slot in the buffer.
那么缓冲区至少有一个空闲槽位。

609
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,530
You can insert a new item.
你可以插入一个新项目。

610
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:26,920
Right?
对吗？

611
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:35,660
This is what any questions?
这是什么问题？

612
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,700
You see that fundamentally,
你可以看到，从根本上说，

613
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,580
what you do is condition variable.
你所做的是条件变量。

614
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,790
Here is like you mentioned earlier,
这是你之前提到的地方，

615
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,170
is to signal between threads.
是用来在线程之间进行信号传递的。

616
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,760
When an event occurs.
当事件发生时。

617
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,920
In this particular case,
在这种特殊情况下，

618
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:01,890
the producer signal to consumer when it's inserted an element in the buffer
当生产者向缓冲区插入一个元素时，会向消费者发出信号。

619
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:12,250
and the consumer signals to the producer when it removed an element
当消费者移除一个元素时，它向生产者发出信号。

620
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,930
from the buffer.
从缓冲区中。

621
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,590
Now, the producer now that for sure it can add a new element is above.
现在，生产者确信它可以添加一个新元素。

622
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:31,660
Also, again, I want to reiterate that the thread when he's waiting,
另外，我想再次强调，当他在等待时，线程应该如何处理。

623
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,700
it doesn't do busy,
它不会忙碌，

624
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:35,750
waiting is sleeping.
等待就是睡眠。

625
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,940
The condition variable,
条件变量，

626
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,870
the semantics there or can't wait,
那里的语义或者等不及了

627
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,770
is to take that thread,
是将该线程进行处理，

628
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:50,140
put it on the wait queue and release the lock to the critical section.
将其放入等待队列并释放对临界区的锁定。

629
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,360
Rough lock.
粗糙的锁。

630
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,360
Can you construct monitor from some of us?
你能从我们中的一些人构建监视器吗？

631
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,070
The locking aspect is easy, right?
加锁的部分很容易，对吗？

632
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,710
Remember,
记住，

633
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,790
you can use a semaphore which has only two values.
你可以使用一个只有两个值的信号量。

634
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:14,470
And the way it's basically decrementing, the semaphore.
而且它的基本操作是对信号量进行递减。

635
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,610
If it's one, you initialize on 4~1.
如果是1，你在4~1上进行初始化。

636
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,610
If it's one, you require the lock, and it's zero.
如果它是1，你需要锁定，如果是0。

637
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:24,550
If someone else said calm since one to decrement it,
如果有其他人说要冷静，那么就减少一次。

638
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,940
then it came out and discussed the white.
然后它出现并讨论了白色。

639
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:27,600
Right?
对吗？

640
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:30,480
Because you need to wait for the someone else,
因为你需要等待别人，

641
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,180
increase you to increment the semaphore back to one.
将信号量增加到一。

642
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,080
Right?
对吗？

643
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,800
This will be the signal, right?
这将是信号，对吗？

644
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:40,440
So you see things.
所以你能看到事物。

645
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:47,770
But the biggest problem here is that the wait,
但是这里最大的问题是等待时间，

646
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,850
if you do that,
如果你这样做的话，

647
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,650
while you are in a critical section,
当你处于临界区时，

648
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,930
and you have to do that to be in the critical section,
并且你必须这样做才能进入临界区。

649
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,150
then we are going to wait,
那么我们就等待吧。

650
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,630
and you are not going to release a lock.
而且你不会释放锁。

651
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:58,650
Right?
对吗？

652
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,650
So that's the key.
所以这就是关键。

653
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,590
The monitors on the conditioned variable, conditioned weight,
条件变量上的监视器，条件权重，

654
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,610
that function is releasing the lock atomically when you go to sleep.
当你进入睡眠状态时，该函数会原子地释放锁。

655
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:09,920
Right?
对吗？

656
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,500
And are this working?
这个工作吗？

657
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,580
This is what about this?
这是关于什么的？

658
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:16,580
One, right?
一个，对吗？

659
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,670
You release a lock, you put that you release a lock immediately.
当你释放一个锁时，你应该立即标明你已经释放了该锁。

660
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:22,440
Right?
对吗？

661
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,920
You after wait, right?
你是在等待吗？

662
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:33,570
This will not work in one of the reasons the conditional variables are have
这将无法工作的一个原因是条件变量存在问题。

663
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,390
no history in the sense that I always signal.
没有历史记录，意味着我总是发送信号。

664
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,430
If I signal you 5 times,
如果我向你发出5次信号，

665
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:41,040
you are going to be open only once, right?
你只会开放一次，对吗？

666
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,190
But some of us have history.
但是我们中的一些人有历史。

667
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:44,970
Let me see.
让我看看。

668
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,540
So this is exactly what I was saying.
所以这正是我所说的。

669
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,100
It's a great question that I will.
这是一个很好的问题，我会解答的。

670
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,830
The question is,
问题是，

671
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,750
if the buffer is half full,
如果缓冲区半满，

672
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:08,820
will the condition variable still going to signal in a a is a in the either
在条件变量中，如果一个线程在等待状态中，那么当条件满足时，它将被唤醒。

673
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,120
case?
案例？

674
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,220
Absolutely.
当然可以。

675
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,330
That's exactly what we mean here.
这正是我们在这里所指的。

676
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,370
The condition variable has no history.
条件变量没有历史记录。

677
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,160
You are going to be signaled.
你将会被发出信号。

678
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,140
In that case, a signal doesn't mean anything,
在这种情况下，信号没有任何意义。

679
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,220
because you may not,
因为你可能不行，

680
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:27,570
if you signal and there is no thread on waiting, then nothing will happen.
如果你发送一个信号，但没有线程在等待，那么什么都不会发生。

681
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,410
Very good question.
非常好的问题。

682
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:43,420
And,
而且，

683
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,380
yeah, this is exactly what I said.
是的，这正是我所说的。

684
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,980
It was if the thread signals and no one is waiting,
如果线程发出信号而没有人在等待，那就是这样。

685
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,060
there is no operation.
没有操作。

686
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,820
There is no.
没有。

687
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,970
If a sled later waits,
如果一个雪橇稍后等待，

688
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,080
then it's a problem right now here.

689
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,200
But because it's, again,

690
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,610
if that happens,
如果发生这种情况，

691
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:05,700
then it's going to you wait with your visa lock.
那么你需要等待你的签证被锁定。

692
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:11,630
And the other thread cannot increment the semaphore.
另一个线程无法对信号量进行递增操作。

693
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,220
Which correspond to the lock.
对应于锁。

694
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:18,480
So you are going to be to be stuck.
所以你将会被困住。

695
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,230
Anyway.
无论如何。

696
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,180
So there are a bunch of questions here,
所以这里有一堆问题，

697
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,400

701
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,810

00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,540
because you have running a little bit out of time,
因为你的时间有点不够了，

703
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:54,440
I want to go to the next part of the lecture,

704
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,760
which is extremely important part of the lecture.

705
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:05,080
And this is about reader and write that problem.

707
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,540
Ii think I don't have the announcement before going there.

708
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,000
Let me do verbally.
让我口头来做。

709
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:25,850
And i'm going to add the slide about the announcement to the lecture right
我将在讲座中添加关于公告的幻灯片。

710
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,970
after the lecture slide,
在讲义幻灯片之后，

711
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,090
right after the election.
选举结束后立即。

712
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,490
So basically, the most important thing is that obviously,
基本上，最重要的是显然，

713
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,370
next week,
下周，

714
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:41,670
we are going to have the first meter and to be between seven and nine.
我们将进行第一次测量，时间将在七点到九点之间。

715
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,720
On wednesday,
周三，

716
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:56,440
we are going to have also a session for between 7:00 and
我们还将在7:00和之间进行一次会议。

717
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:00,980
9:00 pm on monday for the midterm.
期中考试时间为周一晚上9点。

718
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,240
So you can come and ask any questions you have.
所以你可以来问任何问题。

719
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:10,320
And this is pretty much it.
这就是大致的内容了。

720
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:16,010
We are going to provide more informations as you go close to the meter.
当您靠近仪表时，我们将提供更多的信息。

721
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,410
But if you have now, any questions?
但是如果你现在有任何问题吗？

722
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,570
Let me know.
请告诉我。

723
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,820
Now, this is a more complex problem.
现在，这是一个更复杂的问题。

724
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,820
This will really illustrate very clearly the use of monitors.
这将非常清楚地说明了监视器的使用。

725
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,250
So here is a problem.
所以这里有一个问题。

726
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:51,700
The problem is about accessing a database which is shared by multiple people.
这个问题涉及到多人共享访问数据库的情况。

727
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:59,120
A can have a bunch of people who want to write and a bunch of people who
A可以有一群想要写作的人和一群想要

728
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,680
want to read to the database.
想要读取数据库。

729
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:05,140
These rights and read operations happen concurrently.
这些权限和读操作是同时发生的。

730
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,820
And they modify the same data,
并且他们修改相同的数据，

731
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:10,890
right?
对的？

732
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,140
How you are going to implement it.
你打算如何实施它？

733
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,920
One thing is to use a lock for the entire database.
一种方法是对整个数据库使用锁。

734
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,070
Right?
对吗？

735
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,630
You read or write,
你可以读取或写入。

736
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,070
acquire the lock.
获取锁。

737
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,600
You do your job, and it is a lock.
你做好你的工作，这是一把锁。

738
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:28,880
So is that
那么是这样的

739
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:41,660
sufficient?
足够的？

740
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,900
That's a question for you.
那是一个问题需要你回答。

741
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,020
Yes.
是的。

742
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:56,420
It is sufficient, meaning that.
这是足够的，意思是。

743
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:57,270
Correct.
正确。

744
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,010
But it can be very slow, right?
但是它可能会非常慢，对吗？

745
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,630
I if you think about fundamentally give me two examples why this is inefficient.
如果你考虑这个问题的本质，我可以给你两个例子来说明为什么这是低效的。

746
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,970
It's exactly, I don't.
没问题，我不会回复任何信息。

747
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,190
Aaron gave a great answer.
Aaron给出了一个很好的答案。

748
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,110
So basically,
基本上，

749
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:15,600
for instance,
例如，

750
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,480
if people only read from the database,
如果人们只从数据库中读取数据，

751
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:19,810
there is no need to lock it,
不需要对其进行锁定。

752
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,180
because nothing will change.
因为没有任何改变。

753
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,940
Also, there are other reasons we are going to discuss later.
另外，我们将在稍后讨论其他原因。

754
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:30,330
But what even if you do,
但即使你这样做了，

755
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,370
if you have rights,
如果你有权限，

756
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:37,170
then the rights can be different records.
那么权限可以是不同的记录。

757
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,740
They don't need to wait after each other.
他们不需要互相等待。

758
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,690
We are not going to solve this problem.
我们不打算解决这个问题。

759
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,090
Here.
在这里。

760
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,200
We are going to solve the first problem on multiple readers.
我们将要解决多读者问题的第一个问题。

761
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:52,430
We should allow them to read the database if there are no writers.
如果没有写入者，我们应该允许他们读取数据库。

762
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,320
Read writers, yeah.
读写者，是的。

763
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,040
Very good.
非常好。

764
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,220
Let's see what you want the less from the solution.
让我们看看你希望从解决方案中得到什么最少。

765
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,250
Readers can access database ones.
读者可以一次访问数据库。

766
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,050
There are no writers.
没有作家。

767
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:10,790
This is exactly like we said.
这就像我们之前说的一样。

768
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,260
If there are no writers, no,
如果没有写入者，不，

769
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,750
no value will change.
没有任何值会改变。

770
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,790
So therefore,
因此，

771
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,870
the readers, any number of readers can read concurrent.
读者，任意数量的读者可以并发阅读。

772
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,680
Writers can access database,
作者可以访问数据库。

773
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:33,770
a writer can access a database when there is no reader reading.
只有在没有读者读取时，写入者才能访问数据库。

774
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,370
Now, as a writer modifying the database.
现在，作为一个修改数据库的写入者。

775
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,080
And finally, we have some state variables.
最后，我们有一些状态变量。

776
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:48,650
We want only one thread to modify them at a given time.
我们希望在任何给定的时间只有一个线程来修改它们。

777
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,210
Right?
对吗？

778
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,400
This is,
这是，

779
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,660
so this is the basic solution,
所以这是基本解决方案，

780
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,240
the structure for the reader.
读者的结构。

781
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:04,050
You wait until there are no writers access a database,
你等待直到没有任何写操作访问数据库。

782
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:13,600
check out and wake up waiting writers and the writer
检查并唤醒等待的写入者和写者。

783
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:20,160
waiting wait until there are no active readers or writers access database,
等待直到没有活动的读者或写者访问数据库。

784
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:24,720
and then you check out and you wake up as awaiting readers or writers.
然后你结账，然后你醒来时成为等待读者或写者。

785
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:33,820
So let me ask you this question.
那么让我问你这个问题。

786
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:37,340
You see here,
你看到这里，

787
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,580
there is some asymmetry, some asymmetry.
存在一些不对称性，一些不对称性。

788
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:44,430
There is the river driven is derived from our constraints.
这条河流的驱动力源于我们的限制。

789
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,230
Right?
对吗？

790
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,750
If a reader,
如果一个读者，

791
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,290
it doesn't need to wait until there are no other readers,
它不需要等到没有其他读者了才能进行。

792
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,820
because it doesn't conflict with other readers,
因为它不会与其他读者发生冲突。

793
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,460
it can only conflict with writers.
它只会与写入者发生冲突。

794
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,290
That's how you wait until no writers.
这是等待直到没有写者的方法。

795
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:03,840
The writers is going to conflict bosses, readers, and writers.
这位作家将与老板、读者和其他作家发生冲突。

796
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:07,300
Because if a reader is going to read the data,
因为如果一个读者要读取数据的话，

797
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,480
while the writer changing the data,
当写入者正在更改数据时，

798
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,140
it can read, the reader can read garbage.
它可以读取，读取器可以读取垃圾数据。

799
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,530
But then there is another estimate when a writer is done, is done,
但是当一个作家完成了作品之后，又会有另一个估计。

800
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:22,870
is going to wait three wake up readers and writers.
将等待三个唤醒读者和写者。

801
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,170
While when the reader is done,
当读者完成时，

802
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,080
is only tried to wake up writers.
只是试图唤醒作家们。

803
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:29,590
Why this asymmetric?
为什么是不对称的？

804
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,000
Why do you think?
你觉得为什么呢？

805
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,580
Why do you think the reader is not just waiting algorithms?
为什么你认为读者不仅仅是在等待算法？

806
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,230
Waking up algorithms?
唤醒算法？

807
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,290
Very good.
非常好。

808
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,330
The readers are all concurrent so that it should be known
读者都是并发的，因此应该知道这一点。

809
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,010
as any other reader to wake up.
和其他读者一样醒来。

810
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,170
Very good.
非常好。

811
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:01,730
Okay.
好的。

812
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:03,940
Let's move on.
让我们继续吧。

813
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,210
How do we implement this with our monitor?
我们如何使用我们的监视器来实现这个功能？

814
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,450
Is a beautiful abstraction we just learned about.
这是我们刚刚学到的一个美丽的抽象概念。

815
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:11,730
Right?
对吗？

816
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:14,040
So, you see,
所以，你看到，

817
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:19,090
wake up a waiting a writer and wake up waiting readers or writers.
唤醒等待的写入者并唤醒等待的读取者或写入者。

818
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,410
What are these?
这些是什么？

819
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,500
You can implement them.
你可以实现它们。

820
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:29,400
Condition variables is like signals and wait and waiting,
条件变量类似于信号和等待操作。

821
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:31,090
going to that conditional variable.
前往该条件变量。

822
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:37,220
We have two conditional variables to read to write.
我们有两个条件变量用于读写。

823
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:41,880
Then what are the state variables?
那么状态变量是什么？

824
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,940
The number of active readers,

863
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,140
but why is that?

873
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:34,730
And in the meantime, I have another reader which wants to read.
同时，我还有另一个读取器想要读取。

Simon has a great question here.
Simon提出了一个很好的问题。

912
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:57,530
What new writers are coming all the time when you get to read,
当你开始阅读时，会有哪些新的作家不断涌现？

913
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,050
if you keep waiting for all writers to finish.
如果你继续等待所有的写手完成。

914
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,310
That's correct.
没错。

915
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,280
So in this particular case,
在这种特殊情况下，

916
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,780
if writers come up all the time,
如果作家们一直涌现出来，

917
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:10,460
you are not going to get a chance to it.
你不会有机会去做这件事。

918
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,250
In practice, you need to be a little bit more sophisticated.
在实践中，你需要更加复杂一些。

919
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:23,820
But that's a good..
但这是一个好的..

920
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:28,600
This is one question here,
这里有一个问题。

921
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:31,000
is why do you want why you release locks there?
为什么你想要在那里释放锁？

922
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:35,600
Why don't you release a lock all the way to the end?
为什么不将锁一直释放到最后？

923
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:48,410
Why is not access database part of the critical section here?
为什么访问数据库不是临界区的一部分？

924
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,710
So any readers can get the lock.
这样任何读者都可以获得锁。

925
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,970
You don't change the state variables.
你不改变状态变量。

926
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,210
The locks are for changing the state variables.
这些锁是用来改变状态变量的。

927
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,350
In this particular case,
在这种特殊情况下，

928
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,390
you also want all the readers.
你也希望所有的读者。

929
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,270
If there are only active readers in the system,

930
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,620
if there are only leaders in the system,

932
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:23,760
right?

00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,870
Very good answers.
非常好的答案。

934
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:32,250
Now, let's see.
现在，让我们来看一下。

935
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:35,940
The code for the writer is very similar.
写者的代码非常相似。

936
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:37,900
Right?
对吗？

There should be no active readers.
不应该有活跃的读者。

940

You cannot write.
你不能写。

941
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,590
While you have readers reading the data,

942
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:55,990
you need manipulating the state variables.

948
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,640
If not, you are going to increment active writers,

949
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,120
because now you are an active writer,
因为现在你是一位活跃的作家，

950
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:22,370
it is a lock.

951
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,180
You ask the database, read, write.

952
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:29,480
Then once you are done,
完成后，

953

然后你检查是否还有等待的写者数量，

957
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:49,980

是的，但是作者无法修改状态。

971
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:57,910
So we are going to be fine.

999
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:57,170
Initially, all the state variables are set to zero.
最初，所有状态变量都被设置为零。

1000
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,050
Let's see what happens.

1009
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:28,260
You exit the while loop.

1010
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,640
And r one can start reading.
然后，一个人可以开始阅读了。

1011
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:36,020
You increment the active reader variable,

1018
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:05,720
because r one is still accessing the database.

Now it's checking whether it's an active writer or a waiting writer,
现在正在检查是活跃的写者还是等待的写者，

1024
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:24,620
none this none such strategy in the system.
系统中没有这样的策略。

1025
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:28,630
So,
那么，

1026
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:36,160
again, you skip the while up and increment the number of active writers.
再次强调，你跳过了 while 循环并增加了活跃写者的数量。

1027
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:41,780
These are lock and you access the database.
这些是锁，你可以使用它们来访问数据库。

1031
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,870
Now, it's again assume that it does take a while to access database
现在，再次假设访问数据库需要一些时间。

1032
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:22,020
and assume that during this time,
并假设在此期间，

1033
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,320
now when w is a writer,
现在当 w 是一个写者时，

1034

01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:33,230
The writer is going to execute the writer code.
作者将要执行写入者代码。

1037
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:40,780
So it acquires a lock and now it looks at active writers and active readers

executing this slide.
执行此幻灯片。

1104
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:08,670
It acquires a lock back because remember,

1105
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:15,990
we are still in the critical section decrement number of waiting writers.
我们仍然在临界区内，减少等待写者的数量。

1106
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,080
I am no longer waiting now.
我现在不再等待了。

1107

1115
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,130
You are guaranteed it will not be greater than one.

1117
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,010
you acquire the lock,
你获得了锁。

1118
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,520
you decline the number of active writers.
你减少了活跃作家的数量。

1119
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:05,250
And now you look to signal.
现在你要关注信号。

1120
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:09,010
Again, you give priority to the waiting writers,

1126
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:27,990
Therefore, you are going to look where there are waiting readers.
因此，你将查找等待读者的位置。

1127
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,850
There is one is r three.
有一个是r三。

1128
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:40,140
Then you are going to signal to r three that it can is okay to continue to read.
然后你要向r3发出信号，告诉它可以继续读取了。

1129
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:49,030
Now we start executing the code for our three,

1149
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,820
There are two ways to do it.

如果我们在读取器x中删除一个条件检查会怎么样？

1170
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:04,700
Basically, we say wherever a reader finishes,
基本上，我们说无论读者在哪里结束阅读，

just for the writer to go immediately back to sleep.
让作者立即回去睡觉。

1201
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,600
So just graduates contacts region.

1210
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:47,490
instead of having a condition broadcast to write?
是否可以改为使用条件广播来进行写操作？

1211
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:51,610
You broadcast to write every analog instead of the signal?

1241
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:33,410
call it continue instead of two separate ones,
将其称为"继续"而不是两个独立的操作。

1242
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:37,460
both readers and writers are going to wake up.

These are going to be correct.

1244
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:52,680
It's going to be correct for the same reason.
这个原因也是正确的。

1245
01:17:53,740 --> 01:18:01,020
Neither writer nor the right reader are going to continue if the test

1246
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:01,980
for the while loop.
对于 while 循环。

1247

1248
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,110
So here is what happens,

1249

And this is what i'm going to end up with this one.
这就是我最终要得到的结果。

1251
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:23,640
So you can use one.

1252

But,

01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:30,770

although there is in theory that there is one thing here,

1255
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:39,080

This is correct with one condition to continue that it's actually,
只有在满足一个条件的情况下，这个说法才是正确的，那就是实际上，

1257
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:55,310
if I continue is going to wake up one single thread,
如果我继续执行，将会唤醒一个单个线程。

这个单线程是错误的，现在进入休眠状态，这里是一个下沉点。

If I wake up,

1260
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,950
if I do, if I have only one continue conditional variable,

I wake up the reader,

But now these signals were spent out.

1268

1274
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:42,640
we are deadlocked.
我们陷入了僵局。

1275
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:45,250
In order for this tour at work,
为了这次工作参观，

1276
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:52,380
need to also change this signal from the right reader to broadcast.
还需要将来自右侧读取器的信号改为广播。

1277
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:54,110
Okay?
好的？

1278
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,150
Okay, so you need to broadcast.
好的，所以你需要进行广播。

And you also need to broadcast,

so you need to do some changes.

1282
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:08,020
So,

1283
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:13,320
so the summary here and we are going to end up with this is

that these wild looks are extremely powerful,

If you are woken up by mistake.

1288

So we are safe.

1289
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:36,690
So what we need to be careful about is that because there is no history

1290
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,250
with this condition variables,

but the wrong thread.

1293
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:46,300
But then if I am waking up the wrong thread,

1294
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:49,180
that signal was wasted,

and the correct thread will not be open up.

1296
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:55,580
So you can have deadlocks.

1297
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:02,030
So that's why here you need to be careful what you need to be careful about.
所以这就是为什么在这里你需要注意你需要注意的事情。

1298

所以我们最终会得到这个。

The why look give us good protection?

1315
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:55,650
But doesn't that cost a lot of cpu cycles since we are constantly pulling?
但是这样做会消耗大量的CPU周期，因为我们不断地进行拉取操作。

1316
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:56,750
Absolutely.
当然可以。

1317
01:21:56,970 --> 01:21:57,860
It's inefficiency.
这是低效的。

1318

It's your absolutely correct.

1319

It's inefficient.

It's correct, but inefficient.
这是正确的，但效率不高。

1321
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:08,340
And from Chad,
来自乍得，

1322
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:14,610
wouldn't this possibly make a finished writers broadcast hit awaiting reader?
这是否可能使得一篇完成的作家广播等待读者的作品受欢迎呢？

1323
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:15,890
First before awaiting reader,
首先，在等待读者之前，

1324
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:18,590
if there was both waiting read as a writer,
如果既有读者等待又有写者等待的情况下，

1325
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:23,540
which means observed ordering priority of writers of writers before readers,
这意味着在读者之前观察到的写者的写入顺序优先级。

1326
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:29,170
this will no longer guarantee the priority order between writers and readers.
这将不再保证写者和读者之间的优先顺序。

1327
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:31,510
If you have only one conditioned variables,
如果你只有一个条件变量，

1328
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:36,290
you are no longer going to be guaranteed this one unnecessary,

1329
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:44,280
although it is still,
尽管如此，

1330
01:22:44,690 --> 01:22:49,240
II you are not guaranteed readers when you wake up,
当你醒来时，并不能保证有读者。

1331
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:51,070
but still in,
但仍然在进行中，

1332
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:52,510
if you want to proceed,
如果你想继续，

1333
01:22:53,150 --> 01:22:55,470
you are the while loop will take care of that.
你可以使用 while 循环来处理这个。

1334
01:22:57,050 --> 01:22:59,480
In from the point of view of accessing the database,
从访问数据库的角度来看，

1335
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:04,790
the while loop is going to enforce a priority because a reader,
while循环将强制执行优先级，因为一个读者，

1336
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:11,680
it's going to look whether there are active writers or waiting writers.
它将检查是否有活跃的写者或等待中的写者。

1337
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:13,480
And if they are waiting writers,
如果他们是等待的作家，

1338
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,100
it's not going to proceed.
无法继续进行。

1339
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:16,120
Right?
对吗？

1340
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:18,550
So as long as they are waiting writers,
只要他们是等待的写入者，

1341
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:23,280
these wire conditions will ensure that the reader cannot proceed.
这些线路条件将确保读者无法继续操作。

1342
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:25,350
So actually,
实际上，

1343
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:29,110
the priority is still enforced.
优先级仍然得到执行。

1344
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:30,900
Okay?
好的？

1345
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:34,370
The priority is enforced by the while of conditions.
优先级是通过条件的 while 循环来实施的。

1346
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:41,620
But the priority is not enforcing the sense that you can wake
但是优先级不在于强制你能够醒来的感觉。

1347
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:46,020
up every a reader while you shouldn't have woken up.
在你还没有醒来的时候，每个读者都不应该被唤醒。

1348
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:48,030
And this can lead,
这可能会导致，

1349
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:56,450
again to deadlocks without without changing the code and more be
再次讨论死锁问题，不改变代码的情况下，并且更深入地研究。

1350
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:59,170
more liberal in broadcasting the ok continue.
在广播方面更加自由开放，好的，继续。

1351
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:00,400
Okay.
好的。

1352
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:01,590
Thank you.
谢谢你。

1353
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,310
And i'll see you on Tuesday and Monday.
