1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,100
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

2
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,360
Hello everybody.
大家好。

3
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,120
So welcome to the 11th lecture.
所以欢迎来到第11讲。

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,920
So hopefully you hear me.
希望你能听到我。

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,680
And today we are going to continue our discussion about scheduling.
今天我们将继续讨论关于日程安排的话题。

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,160
We are going to learn a bit about fairness, real time, and making forward progress, avoiding
我们将学习一些关于公平、实时和取得进步的内容，避免

7
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,220
starvation and do one or two case studies.
饥饿和进行一两个案例研究。

8
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:03,260
So one thing just to start with, this was a question I got from some people also before
所以首先，这是我之前从一些人那里得到的一个问题。

9
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,120
the midterm.
期中考试。

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:12,800
It's about what is the operating system scheduling?
操作系统调度是什么？

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,360
Processes or threats?
是指流程还是威胁？

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,000
And the answer obviously is threats.
答案显然是威胁。

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
A process has at least one threat.
一个过程至少有一个威胁。

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,640
So when a process has exactly one threat, then you can think about it's interchangeable.
所以当一个过程只有一个威胁时，你可以认为它是可互换的。

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,480
The kernel will schedule either a process or a threat, you can say.
内核会调度进程或线程，可以这么说。

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:42,000
But obviously when a process has multiple threats, kernel threats, then the operating
但是显然，当一个过程有多个威胁，内核威胁时，操作系统

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,440
system will schedule independently each threat of the process.
系统将独立地为每个进程的威胁进行调度。

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you would like to be translated.

19
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:54,680
Now, the one thing to keep in mind is that when you switch between two contexts, switching
现在，要记住的一件事是，当你在两个不同的情境之间切换时，切换

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,040
between two threads, if you remember, which belong to the same process, that's much quicker
在两个线程之间，如果你记得的话，它们属于同一个进程，那会更快。

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,080
because they are living in the same address space.
因为它们位于相同的地址空间中。

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,480
So you do not need to switch the address space.
所以你不需要切换地址空间。

23
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:13,720
However, when you switch between two threads, which are in different processes, then you
然而，当你在两个不同的进程中切换线程时，你会发现

24
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,560
need also to switch the address space.
还需要切换地址空间。

25
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,440
And that's much more expensive.
这个要贵得多。

26
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,720
Think about one order of magnitude more expensive to switch, to context switch between two threads
考虑到切换两个线程之间的上下文，需要增加一个数量级的开销。

27
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,400
in different processes, then switching between two threads in the same process.
在不同的进程中，然后在同一进程中的两个线程之间切换。

28
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,100
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

29
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:38,280
And also remember here that actually there is this multi-threading or simultaneous multi-threading
并且在这里要记住，实际上存在着多线程或同时多线程的概念。

30
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,960
or hyper-threading, that's kind of the hardware level, which allows you to run multiple threads
或者超线程，那是一种硬件级别的技术，它允许你同时运行多个线程。

31
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,200
on the same core.
在同一个核心上。

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,280
But from the operating system and from the application, the only difference is that with
但是从操作系统和应用程序来看，唯一的区别就是使用了

33
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,920
hyper-threading, you can run more threads, kernel threads at the same time.
超线程技术可以同时运行更多的线程，包括内核线程。

34
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,800
That's the only difference.
这是唯一的区别。

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide the text you would like me to translate.

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,200
Nothing more.
没有更多了。

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:07,880
Now, we discussed last time we did first come first serve, and we also ended up with this
现在，我们上次讨论了我们采用先到先服务的方式，最终也得出了这个结论。

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,840
kind of discipline, which is when we look at the best first come first serve, if you
有一种纪律，就是我们首先看最好的，先来先服务，如果你

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:20,440
know, we are starting with the smallest job first, and then to minimize the waiting time
知道了，我们先从最小的工作开始，然后尽量减少等待时间。

40
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,680
and to minimize the completion time.
并且尽量减少完成时间。

41
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

42
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,440
So, obviously the question here is that for that we need to know the future.
所以，显然问题在于我们需要知道未来。

43
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,920
And if we know the future, can we mirror the best first come first serve?
如果我们知道未来，我们能否将最好的先来先服务反映出来？

44
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,280
And the answer is obviously yes, we all be set what is the discipline.
答案显然是肯定的，我们都会明确自己的纪律。

45
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,280
And that is to run the first job first, right?
是的，那就是先运行第一个任务，对吗？

46
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,280
So whatever job takes the least run, it has priority over other jobs.
所以无论哪个工作所需的时间最短，都优先于其他工作。

47
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

48
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,480
And there are two versions of that.
而且有两个版本。

49
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,720
One it's a preempt, it's non-preemptive version and one and the other one is preemptive version.
其中一个是预防性措施，它是非预防性版本，另一个是预防性版本。

50
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,520
As the name implies for the non-preemptive version, you run each job all the way to completion.
正如其名称所示，非抢占式版本会将每个作业运行到完成。

51
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,440
In the preemptive version, you are going to can preempt the existing jobs for, for instance,
在预抢版本中，你可以抢占现有的任务，例如，

52
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,240
if an existing jobs, say still 10 seconds to run, and now a new job arrives, which has
如果有一个正在运行的任务，比如还需要10秒钟才能完成，现在又来了一个新任务，它需要多长时间才能完成呢？

53
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:27,280
only one second to run, the new job is going to preempt the existing job because it has
只需要一秒钟就能运行，新的工作将会抢占现有的工作，因为它具有

54
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,520
only one second to finish while the previous, while the existing job still has 10 seconds
只需要一秒钟就能完成，而之前的工作和现有的工作还需要10秒钟。

55
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
to finish.
完成。

56
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

57
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,080
And this is about shortest remaining time first, right?
是的，这是关于最短剩余时间优先的算法，对吗？

58
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,600
And this is a preemptive version of shorter job first.
这是一个先发制人的短作业优先版本。

59
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,680
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese into English and any non-Chinese into Chinese. Please provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

60
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,280
So, so remember about that.
好的，好的，请记住这件事。

61
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,320
So this is optimal and you can show that this is optimal from the point of view of reducing
所以这是最优的，你可以从减少的角度证明这是最优的。

62
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,040
or minimizing the completion time.
或者最小化完成时间。

63
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,400
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you need to be translated.

64
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,000
So, so keeping, keep, keep in mind, this is an optimal schedule basically.
所以，记住，这基本上是一个最佳的时间表。

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:19,400
Now so it's so one, one question here is that when you have a shortest remaining time first
现在有一个问题，当你使用最短剩余时间优先算法时，有一个问题。

66
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,840
and if you want to compare with first come first serve, the one question is what if all
而且如果你想与先到先得进行比较，其中一个问题是，如果全部都...

67
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,960
jobs have the same length because it's all jobs at the same length, what you are going
工作的长度都是相同的，因为它们都是相同长度的工作，你正在做什么

68
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,280
to do, all of them are going to take the same time.
做这些事情，它们都需要相同的时间。

69
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,360
And in this case, there is no difference between them, right?
在这种情况下，它们之间没有区别，对吗？

70
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,000
Because it doesn't matter in which order you are going to run because they have, you need
因为无论你以什么顺序运行，都没有关系，因为他们已经有了，你需要的。

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
to break the ties because they all have the same length in some arbitrary fashion and
以某种任意方式打破这些关系，因为它们的长度都相同。

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,800
first come first serve is one of these ways to break the ties.
先到先得是其中一种解决纠纷的方式。

73
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,280
And you are going to get the same results.
你将会得到相同的结果。

74
00:05:51,280 --> 00:06:00,600
Obviously if the jobs have varying length, then with the shorter remaining time first
显然，如果工作的长度不同，那么应该先处理剩余时间较短的工作。

75
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:07,320
is going to prioritize obviously the short jobs and they are not going to go to be stuck
将明显优先考虑短期工作，并且不会陷入困境。

76
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,640
behind the long ones.
长的后面。

77
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,440
Remember that the first come first serve, they didn't have, you may not have a good
记住，先到先得，他们没有，你可能没有好的。

78
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:22,520
average response time when you have a big job and then other small jobs are just stuck
当您有一个大任务时，平均响应时间会增加，而其他小任务则会被堵塞。

79
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,240
behind the big job because all the small jobs are going to inherit the completion time,
因为所有的小任务都要继承完成时间，所以大任务的后面。

80
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,120
the running time of the big job because they have to wait after it.
大任务的运行时间会延长，因为他们需要在之后等待。

81
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,760
Here is a simple example to illustrate the benefit of the shortest remaining time first
这里有一个简单的例子来说明最短剩余时间优先的好处。

82
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,840
against the shortest remaining time first.
对最短剩余时间优先算法的反对。

83
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,280
It's a preemptive version of shorter job first.
这是短作业优先的一种预防性版本。

84
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,920
And here you have two jobs, A and B, and they are CPU bound, meaning that they use only
而这里有两个工作，A和B，它们是CPU密集型的，意味着它们只使用CPU资源。

85
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,720
the CPU, say run for a week or for a long time.
CPU，即中央处理器，可以连续运行一周或者很长时间。

86
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,800
And then you have another job C, which is IO bound.
然后你还有另一份工作C，它是I/O绑定的。

87
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,100
This means that you do an IO operation in one, it takes one minute seconds to do IO operation,
这意味着你在其中进行了一个IO操作，完成这个IO操作需要一分钟的时间。

88
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:18,560
like say read or write to the disk, but then you wait for nine milliseconds for the operation
像读取或写入磁盘这样的操作，但是你需要等待九毫秒才能完成。

89
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,120
to complete.
完成。

90
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,380
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

91
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:31,360
So if you run one of the jobs at a time, then job A or B will use 100% of the CPU and 0%
因此，如果您一次只运行一个作业，那么作业A或B将使用100%的CPU，而另一个作业将使用0%。

92
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,240
of the IO of the disk.
磁盘的输入/输出(IO)速度。

93
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:44,220
While if you run C at the time, C will use 10% of the CPU and 90% of the disk.
当你同时运行C程序时，C程序将使用10%的CPU和90%的磁盘空间。

94
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,520
So what will happen with first come first serve?
那么先到先得的原则会发生什么情况呢？

95
00:07:49,520 --> 00:08:01,960
Once A or B is scheduled, then it's going to hold the CPU for two weeks together.
一旦A或B被安排，那么它们将连续占用CPU两周。

96
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:10,720
And they are going to get in because even if C starts to run, after one minute seconds,
他们会进来的，因为即使C开始跑，一分钟后，

97
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:20,760
it's going to give up the CPU because it has to wait for, you know, to get the IO operation
它将放弃CPU，因为它需要等待IO操作。

98
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
complete.
完成。

99
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Right?
对吗？

100
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:29,280
Now, what about round robin or shorter remaining time first in this particular case?
现在，在这种特殊情况下，轮询或较短剩余时间优先如何处理？

101
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,140
So let's see what happens.
那么让我们看看会发生什么。

102
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:38,720
So this is round robin and assume the round robin, the time slice is 100 milliseconds.
所以这是循环调度，并假设循环调度的时间片是100毫秒。

103
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,780
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

104
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,780
So you're executing round robin every job.
所以你正在执行轮转调度算法来处理每个作业。

105
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:51,760
So let's start with C. It's again, and say the time slice is 100 milliseconds again.
所以我们从C开始。再次，假设时间片是100毫秒。

106
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,920
So you start with C. C runs for one millisecond and then gives up, yields the CPU because
所以你从C开始。C运行了一毫秒，然后放弃，让出CPU，因为

107
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,480
it needs to wait for the IO operation to complete.
它需要等待IO操作完成。

108
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,280
Then you have to run A and then B and C again.
然后你需要先运行A，然后再运行B和C。

109
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:11,400
Now A and B because they're CPU bounded, they are going to take their entire time quanta,
现在A和B因为受限于CPU，它们将会使用完整的时间片，

110
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,120
that is 100 milliseconds.
这是100毫秒。

111
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Right?
对吗？

112
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,800
So in this case, a disk utilization, if you look about, is like from around when you schedule
所以在这种情况下，磁盘利用率，如果你看一下，大约是从你安排的时间开始。

113
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:32,000
C, A, B, C, then it takes to all of them to complete, takes 201 milliseconds, 100 for A,
C, A, B, C, 然后完成它们所需的时间总共是201毫秒，其中A需要100毫秒。

114
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,040
100 for B and one for C. And out of this time, because you are exactly only one IO operation,
100 for B and one for C. 并且在这次中，因为你只有一个IO操作，

115
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,800
because you schedule C only once, the IO operation takes nine milliseconds.
因为你只调度了一次C，所以IO操作需要九毫秒。

116
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:51,440
So the disk utilization is nine over 201, which is 4.5 percent.
所以磁盘利用率是201的九分之一，即4.5%。

117
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Very, very little.
非常非常少。

118
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,640
Now let's say you do the round robin of one milliseconds.
现在假设你进行一毫秒的轮询。

119
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,600
If you do round robin of about one milliseconds, what happens?
如果你执行大约一毫秒的轮询，会发生什么？

120
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,200
You schedule C first, it takes one milliseconds.
你先安排C，它需要1毫秒的时间。

121
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,040
Then C will have to wait for nine milliseconds is going to be in the waiting queue to wait
然后C将不得不等待九毫秒，进入等待队列等待。

122
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,840
for the IO operation to complete.
等待IO操作完成。

123
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,280
And during these nine milliseconds, you are going to alternate between A and B, each of
这九毫秒期间，你将在A和B之间交替进行，每个都要。

124
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,080
them for one milliseconds, because they are ready to always run because they are only
他们只停留了一毫秒，因为他们随时准备奔跑，因为他们只是

125
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,240
CPU bounded.
CPU受限。

126
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,080
And what you get here, the disk utilization is 90 percent.
在这里，你所得到的是磁盘利用率达到了90%。

127
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:39,680
Because C, it's already, once an IO completes, C is ready to launch the next IO.
因为C，一旦一个IO完成，C就准备好启动下一个IO。

128
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,160
The problem here is if you see, and this is great, maximize the disk utilization, but
这里的问题是，如果你看到了，这是很好的，最大化磁盘利用率，但是

129
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,080
in this particular case, you have a loss of context switches, right?
在这个特定的情况下，你有上下文切换的损失，对吗？

130
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,960
Because between A and B, you have a lot of context switches, you know, and at every one
因为在A和B之间，你会有很多上下文切换，你知道的，而且每一个切换都会

131
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,520
millisecond.
毫秒。

132
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,160
Now, what happens is the shortest time first, the shortest time first, remaining time first,
现在，发生的是最短时间优先，最短时间优先，剩余时间优先。

133
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
sorry, shortest remaining time first.
抱歉，最短剩余时间优先算法。

134
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,800
Let's see what happens.
让我们看看会发生什么。

135
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:12,480
First, execute C, like in the previous two cases, it takes one millisecond and then it's
首先，执行C，就像前两种情况一样，它需要一毫秒，然后它就完成了。

136
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:20,800
going to wait for nine milliseconds for the IO to complete.
等待九毫秒以完成IO操作。

137
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:27,000
So C is on the waiting queue, so now you need to schedule between A and B. Let's say you
那么C在等待队列中，现在你需要在A和B之间安排时间。假设你

138
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,520
schedule A. You are going to schedule A until C becomes again ready for execute and C will
日程安排A。您将继续执行日程安排A，直到C再次准备好执行，而C将

139
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,080
become ready to execute when its IO has completed.
当其IO完成时，准备执行。

140
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,720
So after nine milliseconds.
所以经过九毫秒。

141
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,960
So in the first nine seconds, you run A and now C is ready to execute and C takes only
所以在前九秒钟，你运行A，现在C准备执行，C只需要

142
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,360
one second.
一秒钟。

143
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:57,440
So the remaining time to finish for C it's one millisecond while for A it's one week
所以C完成的剩余时间是1毫秒，而A完成的剩余时间是1周。

144
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,080
minus nine milliseconds.
负九毫秒。

145
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,600
So we are going to schedule C. C again takes one millisecond to go to sleep because it's
所以我们要安排C。C再次进入睡眠状态需要一毫秒的时间，因为它是

146
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,120
just waiting for the IO operation to complete.
只是等待IO操作完成。

147
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:16,920
And now you have A and B. A remaining time is one week minus nine milliseconds.
现在你有A和B。A剩余时间是一周减去九毫秒。

148
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,340
The remaining time for B, we didn't run at all B, so it's one week.
B的剩余时间，我们一点都没有跑B，所以是一周。

149
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,200
So A is one week minus nine milliseconds, B is one week.
所以A是一周减去九毫秒，B是一周。

150
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:32,720
A will take shorter to complete to terminate, so therefore you are going to schedule again.
A将需要更短的时间来完成终止，因此你需要重新安排日程。

151
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,640
So you do C, A, C, A, C, A until A finishes.
所以你要做C，A，C，A，C，A直到A完成。

152
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,720
Disc utilization 90% and much fewer context switches.
磁盘利用率为90%，上下文切换较少。

153
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,500
Any questions, please ask.
有任何问题，请提问。

154
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,480
Let's make it again more interactive.
让我们再次让它更加互动。

155
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,440
It's pretty hard to just stare at the screen.
只盯着屏幕看真的很难受。

156
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:02,120
So anyway, so now what is the problem with shortest time first?
那么，现在最短时间优先算法有什么问题呢？

157
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,140
Shortest remaining time first is starvation.
最短剩余时间优先算法会导致饥饿现象。

158
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,900
So what does it mean starvation?
饥饿是指人体长时间没有得到足够的食物和营养所导致的身体状况。

159
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,200
Can someone tell me what starvation means and why we are going to have starvation in
the future?

饥饿是指人们因长期缺乏足够的食物而导致身体无法正常运作。未来为什么会出现饥饿问题？

160
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
this case?
这个案件？

161
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:28,660
Never getting to run B never is scheduled.
从来没有机会运行B，从来没有被安排。

162
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,660
Yes, in the previous example, well, in the previous example, actually, after you finish
是的，在之前的例子中，嗯，在之前的例子中，实际上，在你完成之后

163
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,860
A you are going to eventually run.
你最终会去跑步的。

164
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,320
So yes, B will wait a long time, but starvation means that it may never be, you may never
所以是的，B会等很长时间，但饥饿意味着它可能永远不会实现，你可能永远不会。

165
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,600
run a job.
运行一个任务。

166
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:53,000
OK, any other answer?
好的，还有其他答案吗？

167
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,200
So starvation means that the job remains in the system without ever being run.
饥饿状态意味着作业在系统中保留而从未被执行。

168
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,760
When can this happen?
这个什么时候可以发生？

169
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,140
That's great.
太好了。

170
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:17,780
So Alison, so if you have a stream of short jobs, you always get new short jobs, then
那么，艾莉森，如果你有一连串的短期工作，你总是能够得到新的短期工作，那么

171
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:22,800
the long job may never be scheduled.
这个长期的工作可能永远不会被安排。

172
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,660
That's exactly what happens.
这正是发生的事情。

173
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,740
OK.
Sure. Please go ahead and provide the text you would like me to translate.

174
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,860
The other problem with this shortest remaining time first is that you need to predict the
另一个问题是，使用最短剩余时间优先算法需要预测

175
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,860
future, you need to know how long a job is going to take.
未来，你需要知道一项工作需要多长时间完成。

176
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,060
And there was a question or two last lectures about this.
还有一两个问题在上一堂课上提到了这个。

177
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:51,540
And there are some ways, none of them is perfect.
有一些方法，但没有一个是完美的。

178
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,420
One way is to rely on the users and as the users, how long will take the job or a job
一种方法是依靠用户，作为用户，需要多长时间来完成工作或一项工作？

179
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,420
will take.
会拿。

180
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,660
But with this has certain problems.
但是这也存在一些问题。

181
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:07,860
First of all, you assume the user knows, which is not always true or which is rarely true.
首先，你假设用户已经知道，但这并不总是真实的，或者很少是真实的。

182
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:14,940
And also you open yourself to an attack in the sense that a user, because if the user
而且你会暴露自己受到攻击的风险，因为用户可以...

183
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,860
knows that the system using the shortest remaining time first will declare a very short time,
知道使用最短剩余时间优先的系统会声明一个非常短的时间。

184
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,780
even if the job will take long, because in this way, she can ensure that the job will
即使工作需要很长时间，因为这样她可以确保工作会

185
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,980
be scheduled.
安排好了。

186
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,940
The other thing which is not here is basically to keep the history.
另外一件不在这里的事情基本上是为了保留历史。

187
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:39,300
If you run a job repeatedly, you look at the history and if you see how long you basically
如果您反复运行一个任务，您可以查看历史记录，如果您看到了基本的运行时间，

188
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:45,980
assume that the past running time is a good predictor for the future running time for
假设过去的运行时间是未来运行时间的一个很好的预测指标。

189
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,980
the same job.
同样的工作。

190
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,980
And you are going to use that prediction.
你打算利用那个预测。

191
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,940
But anyway, so this is hard.
但无论如何，这很困难。

192
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:59,460
However, shortest running time first is still a very important discipline for one reason.
然而，以最短运行时间为先的原则仍然是一个非常重要的规则，原因有一点。

193
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,040
It represents a yardstick.
它代表了一个标准。

194
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,460
It's a baseline for measuring other policies when it comes to minimize the average response
这是在最小化平均响应时衡量其他政策的基准。

195
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,460
time.
时间。

196
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,460
So it's optimal.
所以它是最优的。

197
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,460
You cannot do it better.
你做不得更好。

198
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:18,780
So if you are designing a new scheduler, one of the metrics will be average response time
如果你正在设计一个新的调度器，其中一个指标将是平均响应时间。

199
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,640
and you are going to compare the average response time of that new discipline or scheduling
你将要比较该新学科或调度的平均响应时间。

200
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:29,780
disciplines you design against the shortest remaining time first.
你设计的学科是以最短剩余时间优先的。

201
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,620
The closer you are, the better you are.
你越近，你就越好。

202
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,580
So in summary, for shortest remaining time first, it's optimal with respect to average
所以总结一下，对于最短剩余时间优先算法来说，它在平均情况下是最优的。

203
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,580
response time, but it can be hard to predict the future.
回应时间，但是预测未来可能会很困难。

204
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:51,420
You need to predict the future and this is hard and can be unfair here means also starvation.
你需要预测未来，这是困难的，也可能是不公平的，这里还意味着饥饿。

205
00:16:51,420 --> 00:17:00,580
The long jobs may never be scheduled.
长时间的工作可能永远不会被安排。

206
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:08,280
So this is what I said in the early, this is one way to implement what I said in the
之前我说的是这样的，这是一种实现我所说的方法之一。

207
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,820
previous slides that one way is to predict is based on the past behavior.
以往的幻灯片中提到的一种预测方法是基于过去的行为。

208
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:19,920
So you look at how long a particular job or process, the burst time in the previous burst
所以你要看一下特定工作或过程的持续时间，即前一次的爆发时间。

209
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:27,640
time and you use that as a prediction for the future of times and for the future.
时间，你将其用作对未来时间和未来的预测。

210
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,480
And one way is to do is to do this exponential averaging in which you are going to put away
一种方法是进行指数平均，你将会将其放置在一边。

211
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:46,500
against the duration of the last time the job runs and then discount to, and one minus
对于上次作业运行的持续时间进行折扣，并取其相反数。

212
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,360
alpha for the existing prediction.
现有预测的α值。

213
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,860
So you have an existing prediction and then you are going to put, you can multiply that
所以你有一个现有的预测，然后你要进行加工，可以对其进行乘法运算。

214
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:04,320
for existing prediction with a weight and then you add to one minus weight the last
对于现有的预测，使用一个权重，并将其加到1减去权重的最后一个。

215
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,180
running time of the job.
工作的运行时间。

216
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:17,680
So at one extreme, if you wait with zero, the previous prediction, this means that you
所以在一个极端情况下，如果你等待的时间为零，即前一个预测，这意味着你

217
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:23,280
don't care about the past execution, but the last one, because the weight will be one for
不要在意过去的执行情况，只关注最后一次，因为它的权重将为1。

218
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
the last execution.
最后一次执行。

219
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,880
And if you have a small weight for the last execution, this means that you are going to
而且如果你在最后一次执行时使用了较小的重量，这意味着你打算

220
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:38,160
put a lot of weight on the previous executions before the last one.
在最后一次执行之前，非常重视之前的执行记录。

221
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,640
So what about the fairness?
那公平性呢？

222
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,300
And this is a very important aspect we are going to talk about.
这是我们要讨论的一个非常重要的方面。

223
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,800
We discuss about first come first serve, not really fair.
我们讨论的是先到先得，不太公平。

224
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,160
We discuss about shortage of first, not really necessarily fair.
我们讨论的是短缺问题，而不是公平性问题。

225
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,620
We discuss about Ron Robin, actually that's kind of fair.
我们讨论了一下罗恩·罗宾，其实这还算公平。

226
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:13,640
And now, keep in mind that this kind of fairness is another very important metric we are going
现在，请记住，这种公平性是我们另一个非常重要的指标。

227
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,240
to use to characterize the scheduler.
用于描述调度程序的方式。

228
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:26,600
And fundamentally there is a strict, it's a hard trade-off between the average response
和根本上有一个严格的、艰难的权衡，这是平均响应的结果。

229
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,600
time and the fairness.
时间和公平。

230
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:37,800
And if you remember, we had, last lecture we had this example between the round Robin,
如果你还记得的话，上一堂课我们讲了一个关于轮转调度算法的例子。

231
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:44,780
which is fair because during one round you schedule every process or, you know, every
轮到每个进程或者说每个任务都被调度一次，这是公平的。

232
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,200
every job, and first come first serve.
每个工作，先到先得。

233
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,820
If you remember, we are looking at equal length jobs.
如果你还记得的话，我们正在寻找长度相等的工作。

234
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:03,200
And because if you really want to be fair, everyone will finish at the same time, so
而且，如果你真的想要公平，每个人都会在同一时间完成，所以...

235
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,820
everyone will be late.
大家都会迟到。

236
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:13,820
So her job is response time, while if you are not fair, and you run everyone at comfort,
所以她的工作是响应时间，而如果你不公平，你会让每个人都感到舒适。

237
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:19,380
every job to completion, then the one which you get first are going to finish much earlier
每个工作都要完成，然后先开始的那个会更早完成。

238
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,380
than the last one.
比上一个更好。

239
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,780
So you are going to get better response time.
所以你打算提高响应时间。

240
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:30,580
So keep in mind, the fairness may in general hurt the response time.
所以请记住，公平性可能会普遍影响响应时间。

241
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,620
So how do you, and basically also have other scheduling discipline, like we are going to
那么你是如何安排时间的，基本上也有其他的时间管理方法，比如我们要...

242
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:41,060
learn about fixed priority, and the fixed priority is also fundamental and fair, with
学习固定优先级，固定优先级也是基本和公平的。

243
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:47,260
a priority basically assign different jobs, different priorities, because you deem that
优先级基本上是为不同的工作分配不同的优先级，因为你认为这样做是合理的。

244
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,540
some jobs are more important than the others.
有些工作比其他工作更重要。

245
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,820
And by the way, whenever you say something is more important than the other, basically
而且，顺便说一下，每当你说某件事比另一件事更重要时，基本上

246
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,880
you give up on the fairness at some level.
你在某种程度上放弃了公平。

247
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,260
So how do you implement fairness?
那么你如何实施公平性呢？

248
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:13,060
One is round robin, but the fundamental thing is that to implement fairness, you need, in
一种是循环调度，但最基本的是，为了实现公平性，你需要在实现调度算法时考虑到以下几点：

249
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:20,060
some sense, to divide, to virtualize the CPU, you need to divide the CPU and give each job
一些意义上，要进行CPU虚拟化，你需要将CPU进行划分，并为每个任务分配。

250
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:27,900
a fraction of the CPU.
CPU的一小部分。

251
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,580
And now let's talk a little bit about Unix.
现在让我们稍微谈谈Unix。

252
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:41,660
So in Unix, it's using, in original Unix, it's using priority scheduling.
在Unix中，原始的Unix系统使用的是优先级调度。

253
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:49,300
So you have a bunch of priorities, and if you remember from last time, and the jobs
所以你有一堆优先事项，如果你还记得上次的话，还有工作。

254
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:54,580
that are with the highest priority are going to run first, and jobs with a lower priority
优先级最高的任务将首先运行，而优先级较低的任务将在后面运行。

255
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:02,460
can run only if there are no other jobs with higher priority which are ready to run.
只有在没有其他优先级更高且准备就绪的作业时才能运行。

256
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,840
So this is a call.
这是一个电话。

257
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,700
But now how you are going to get some fairness?
但是现在你打算如何获得一些公平呢？

258
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:13,920
And there are many, many, many proposals.
还有很多很多很多提案。

259
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,500
One way to implement is lottery scheduling.
一种实现的方法是抽签调度。

260
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:26,020
So this one, and it's a very nice analogy, is basically the lottery scheduling will give
所以这个，这是一个非常好的比喻，基本上是说抽奖调度会给予...

261
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,820
each job some number of lottery tickets.
每个工作都会有一定数量的彩票。

262
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,920
And each time slice, you randomly pick a winning ticket.
每个时间片，你随机选择一张中奖票。

263
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:41,900
And on average, the CPU time is proportionally allocated to the number of tickets given to
而且平均而言，CPU时间是按照分配给的票数成比例分配的。

264
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,380
each job.
每个工作。

265
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,500
Now how you can assign the tokens, right?
现在你可以如何分配这些令牌呢？

266
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,500
How you are going to-- and it turns out that the nice thing about this lottery scheduling,
你打算怎么做——结果发现这个抽奖调度的好处是，

267
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:05,740
you can approximate some of these other recipients.
你可以近似地翻译一些其他的收件人。

268
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,460
If you want, or you can use to implement it.
如果你愿意的话，你可以使用它来实施。

269
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:16,300
If you want to implement shortest running time first, you can give to the small jobs
如果你想实施最短运行时间优先，你可以将任务分配给小的工作。

270
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,540
a much larger number of tickets, right?
更多的门票，对吗？

271
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,180
And the long jobs get fewer tickets.
而且长时间的工作得到的票数较少。

272
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:27,140
Now the nice thing is also you can avoid starvation.
现在的好处是你也可以避免饥饿。

273
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,780
If I give to each job at least one ticket, right?
如果我给每个工作至少一张票，对吗？

274
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,700
At least one ticket.
至少一张票。

275
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:43,820
Then that job is not going to be stuck forever because it will be at some point that each
那份工作不会永远被困住，因为总会有一个时刻，每个人都会找到自己的出路。

276
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:51,740
ticket will be selected and therefore it will be scheduled.
票将被选中，因此将被安排。

277
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,960
So this is one advantage of our strict priorities, right?
这就是我们严格优先级的一个优势，对吗？

278
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:06,600
So again, with strict priorities, if a job cannot run unless there is no other job ready
所以，再次强调，如果一个任务只有在没有其他任务准备好的情况下才能运行。

279
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,080
to execute, which has higher priority.
执行，具有更高的优先级。

280
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,960
With this one, we say, okay, the jobs with a higher priority have more tickets, but job
随着这个例子，我们可以说，好吧，优先级更高的工作有更多的票，但是工作

281
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,900
with a lower priority have at least one ticket.
优先级较低的人至少要有一张票。

282
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:25,440
So now I will be stuck.
那么现在我会被困住了。

283
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,480
So here is one example.
这里有一个例子。

284
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:38,460
Lottery scheduling, so assume that you have short jobs and long jobs and you have a job
彩票调度，假设你有短作业和长作业，你有一个作业。

285
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:44,480
get 10 tickets and long job get one ticket, right?
获得10张票，长时间工作获得一张票，对吗？

286
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:56,160
So if a short job gets 10 tickets and a long job gets one ticket, then the CPU get given
那么，如果一个短任务得到10张票，而一个长任务得到一张票，那么CPU会被分配到

287
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,560
to the short jobs is 91%, right?
对于短期工作的比例是91%，对吗？

288
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,120
And the other one is 9%.
另一个是9%。

289
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:08,000
Because in total you have 11 tickets in the system, 10 for the short jobs, one for the
因为您在系统中总共有11张票，其中10张是用于短期工作，一张是用于长期工作。

290
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,440
long jobs.
长时间的工作。

291
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:23,880
If you are going to give, you have two long jobs, okay?
如果你要给的话，你有两个长时间的工作，好吗？

292
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:32,600
And you zero short jobs, you are going to divide because each long job get one ticket.
你没有短工作，你将要分配，因为每个长工作都会得到一张票。

293
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,560
So you have only two tickets in the system.
所以你们系统里只有两张票。

294
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,240
So each of the long jobs will get 50%.
所以每个长期工作都会得到50%的比例。

295
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,220
If you have two short jobs, you have 50% each short jobs, you don't have any long jobs.
如果你有两个短期工作，那么每个短期工作占比50%，你没有任何长期工作。

296
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,000
You have 10 short jobs and one long jobs.
你有10个短工作和一个长工作。

297
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:54,240
You have now 101 tickets in the system because each short job will have 10 tickets.
您现在在系统中有101张票，因为每个短任务都会有10张票。

298
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:04,040
So therefore the short jobs get, each short job get 9.9%.
所以每个短期工作都占总数的9.9%。

299
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,680
All short jobs will get 99%.
所有短期工作将获得99%的报酬。

300
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:12,240
The long job will get 1% and so forth.
长期的工作将获得1%等等。

301
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and translate any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

302
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,440
Let me see if there is a question.
让我看看是否有问题。

303
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,800
Ah, since the scheduling is probabilistic, isn't there still the possibility that the
啊，既然调度是概率性的，那还是有可能的，

304
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,480
long job gets started for quite a while?
这个工作进行了很长时间了吗？

305
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,040
Yes, that's correct.
是的，那是正确的。

306
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:39,120
The long job can still wait for a while, but eventually is going to be selected.
这个长期的工作还可以等一段时间，但最终会被选中。

307
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:53,280
While in, say for instance, with shorter job first or with strict priority scheduling,
在这种情况下，比如说，使用短作业优先或严格优先调度算法，

308
00:26:53,280 --> 00:27:01,040
a job might never ever be scheduled if there are always enough lower priority jobs in the
队列中。

309
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
system.
系统。

310
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Very good question.
非常好的问题。

311
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

312
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:17,800
So, what if too many short jobs are in the system to give reasonable response time?
那么，如果系统中有太多的短期工作，无法在合理的时间内给出响应，该怎么办呢？

313
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:24,240
Well, you know, it can take a long time, so it can be hard to make progress, right?
嗯，你知道的，这可能需要很长时间，所以要取得进展可能会很困难，对吧？

314
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,900
Because there are too many jobs.
因为有太多的工作。

315
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:32,640
So it takes too long to get your tab.
所以要等很久才能拿到你的账单。

316
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:41,760
Of course, one answer here is that, you know, kick some users out of the system.
当然，这里的一个答案是，你知道的，将一些用户从系统中踢出去。

317
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:50,720
So now let's take a step back and let's say, what are the kind of jobs you are expecting
现在让我们退一步来说，你期望的工作类型是什么？

318
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,200
to run on your computer?
在你的电脑上运行？

319
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,720
And typically there is a mix of jobs.
通常情况下，工作种类是多样的。

320
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,000
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you would like to be translated.

321
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,160
So one of them will have the short burst time and some of them longer burst times.
所以其中一个会有短暂的爆发时间，而其他一些会有较长的爆发时间。

322
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,360
And let's think about what are these kinds of jobs?
让我们来思考一下这些工作是什么类型的？

323
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,480
What are the possible ones?
可能的有哪些？

324
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,760
Some jobs are interactive jobs, right?
有些工作是互动性的工作，对吗？

325
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:29,040
These are, you know, it's editors, your chat application, you're interacting with the browser.
这些是，你知道的，它是编辑器，你的聊天应用，你正在与浏览器进行交互。

326
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,600
And these are short bursts, right?
这些是短暂的爆发，对吗？

327
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
It's interactive, right?
是的，它是互动的，对吗？

328
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,280
With the short bursts, they have to respond quickly to the user in your interaction.
使用短暂的爆发，他们必须在与用户的互动中迅速做出回应。

329
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the content you would like to be translated.

330
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,560
Then there are other ones which are IO.
然后还有其他一些是IO的。

331
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,920
It's also IO, not necessarily the users, but they are waiting for networking to get data
这也是IO，不一定是用户，而是他们在等待网络获取数据。

332
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,920
from the network or for an IO to complete, right?
是指从网络上获取数据或完成IO操作，对吗？

333
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:00,840
And there are others which are long running.
还有一些是长期运行的。

334
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:09,440
Like for instance, one example would be a compiler or one example you do training, machine
例如，一个例子是编译器，另一个例子是培训机器。

335
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
learning.
学习。

336
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
Okay.
Sure, I will translate your Chinese text into English and any non-Chinese text into Chinese. Please provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

337
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:20,440
And, you know, you'd expect here that if something is interactive, it has to get a higher priority
而且，你知道的，你会期望如果某个东西是互动的，它必须得到更高的优先级。

338
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,280
because it needs to provide the user good user experience.
因为它需要为用户提供良好的用户体验。

339
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,480
And the one which are not in long running jobs, it's okay if they are not interactive
而那些不是长期运行的工作，如果它们不是交互式的，那也没关系。

340
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,720
because they are running in the background, right?
因为它们在后台运行，对吗？

341
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:38,040
It doesn't matter if a training neural network model is going to take five hours or five
无论训练神经网络模型需要五个小时还是五天，都没有关系。

342
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,160
hours and five minutes.
五小时零五分钟。

343
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
Okay.
Sure, I will do my best to assist you with your translations. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

344
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:46,760
The user will not realize.
用户将不会意识到。

345
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,560
Okay.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

346
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:57,460
So, again, in general, it's hard to characterize all the application, but again, you can classify
因此，总的来说，很难对所有的应用进行概括，但是你可以进行分类。

347
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,120
broadly in interactive applications.
广泛应用于互动应用中。

348
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,380
They typically have short bursts and long running applications, which have obviously
它们通常具有短暂的爆发和长时间运行的应用程序，这显然是

349
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,720
longer bursts.
更长时间的爆发。

350
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:19,640
So in recognizing that, this is how Unix implements the scheduler.
所以，鉴于这一点，这就是Unix实现调度器的方式。

351
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,380
This is multi-level feedback scheduling.
这是多级反馈调度。

352
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:30,760
And the mind level scheduling is like it has a bunch of queues and each queue has a different
优先级。每个队列都有不同的优先级。

353
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:38,520
priority and a different time quan.
优先级和不同的时间量度。

354
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:49,960
So the queue at the top has a highest priority and there were a task, it's a process, it's
所以顶部的队列具有最高优先级，并且有一个任务，它是一个进程。

355
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:57,460
a queue first and the same time quanta, it's eight milliseconds.
一个队列首先，同时也是一个量子，它是八毫秒。

356
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:14,000
And if a job spends too much time on at some level is demoted to the next level, in this
case, it is considered a demotion.

357
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:24,640
case to the next queue, which is quanta of 16 milliseconds.
将案例转移到下一个队列，该队列的时间片为16毫秒。

358
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:31,520
And if you spend too much in this level, at this level, you are demoted to the next queue,
而且如果你在这个级别花费太多，在这个级别上，你会被降级到下一个队列。

359
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,640
which is first count for seven.
第一个是七。

360
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:42,400
So the first two, each of these levels can use a different scheduling discipline.
所以前两个，每个级别都可以使用不同的调度策略。

361
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:49,760
The first two in this case can use round robin, the last one first count for seven.
在这种情况下，前两个可以使用轮询算法，最后一个先计算七次。

362
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,960
So basically what does this mean is that if you have an interactive job, which has small
所以基本上这意味着，如果你有一个交互式的工作，它有一些小的

363
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:04,080
bursts, that will be first and queued at the first level, has a highest priority, it will
爆发，将首先排队在第一层，具有最高优先级，它将

364
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,580
be scheduled quickly.
安排得快一点。

365
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:14,560
And if it's a small burst, then it relinquishes the CPU, goes to sleep.
如果是一个小的爆发，那么它会释放CPU，进入休眠状态。

366
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,640
So it will always remain at the first level.
所以它将始终保持在第一级别。

367
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:25,560
Now consider a long job, like training a neural network.
现在考虑一个长时间的任务，比如训练神经网络。

368
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:35,480
It starts at the first level and after a while, say after several seconds, it's still running
它从第一级开始，过了一段时间后，比如几秒钟后，它仍在运行。

369
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,720
right?
对吗？

370
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,540
It's going to be demoted to the second level.
它将被降级到第二级。

371
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:53,440
And the second level, if it stays and continues running for, say I'm just making up like for
而第二个层次，如果它保持并继续运行，比如我随便编个数字，比如说为了

372
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:00,480
another one hour, then it's pushed to the lower level.
再过一个小时，然后它就会被推到更低的级别。

373
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,280
So you can see that in this way, the jobs which takes a long time, they are going to
所以你可以看到，用这种方式，那些耗时很长的工作，它们将会...

374
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:12,760
fall through these kind of different levels to the bottom level and will have lower priority.
从这些不同的层级中跌落到最底层，并且会具有较低的优先级。

375
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:21,440
It's a very nice mechanism, adaptive mechanism, in which that jobs with short bursts remains
这是一个非常好的机制，自适应机制，其中短时间内有爆发性工作的工作仍然存在。

376
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,880
a high priority, remains a high priority at high levels and the one is lower, which takes
高优先级，在高层级仍然是高优先级，而较低的一个则是次要的。

377
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:42,320
a long time, they are going to be demoted naturally to the levels with a lower priority.
很长一段时间后，它们将自然地被降级到优先级较低的级别。

378
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,880
And the results really here, you can think of approximately the shortest remaining time
结果真的在这里，你可以大致考虑剩余时间最短的情况

379
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,800
first, because if again, if the job is small enough, you always are executed with the highest
首先，因为如果再说一次，如果工作足够小，你总是以最高的执行。

380
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
priority.
优先级。

381
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:10,400
Again, between the queues, you have fixed priorities and then you can have different
再次，在队列之间，你有固定的优先级，然后可以有不同的

382
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:17,680
time quanta like we saw in these examples between different queues.
时间量子，就像我们在不同队列之间看到的这些例子中所见。

383
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:25,840
Oh, here is a question.
哦，这里有一个问题。

384
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,000
This was probably about lottery scheduling.
这可能是关于抽奖调度的事情。

385
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,800
Sorry for not seeing it.
对不起，没有看到它。

386
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,560
Did short job, did a short job and long job run simultaneously?
短工作做了吗，短工作和长工作同时进行了吗？

387
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
Yes.
是的。

388
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,640
In that case, we assume, well, they don't run to completion.
在这种情况下，我们假设，嗯，它们没有完全运行。

389
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:46,520
We assume a lottery scheduling, assume a preemptive scheduling.
我们假设使用抽签调度算法，假设使用抢占式调度算法。

390
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,580
This is a preemptive scheduling discipline.
这是一种预先调度的规则。

391
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:56,400
So you're basically, you know, each time quanta is again, you run a lottery and you award
所以基本上，你知道的，每次量子再次出现，你都会进行一次抽奖，然后颁发奖励。

392
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:02,720
the CPU to the winning ticket, to the process with the winning ticket.
将CPU分配给中奖票，将中奖票分配给中奖进程。

393
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,080
So from that perspective, yes, they are interleaved.
从这个角度来看，是的，它们是交错的。

394
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:13,320
The short jobs, the long run, long jobs are interleaved.
短期工作和长期工作交替进行。

395
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:30,880
Now, obviously, if you know the scheduler, you can actually fool the scheduler.
现在，显然，如果你了解调度程序，你实际上可以欺骗调度程序。

396
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,800
And for instance, if I want, what can I do for my job to remain as a high priority?
例如，如果我想让我的工作保持高优先级，我可以做些什么呢？

397
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:45,480
Well, I'm going to insert some IO operations from time to time because IO operations put
嗯，我会时不时地插入一些IO操作，因为IO操作会导致程序的执行速度变慢。

398
00:35:45,480 --> 00:36:05,640
this the process or the job to sleep and therefore it remain as a high in the top level queues.
这是一个睡眠的过程或工作，因此它会保持在高优先级队列的顶部。

399
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:14,760
And there are actually even games in which it's an old program game and you try to play
而且实际上还有一些游戏，它们是旧的程序游戏，你可以尝试玩。

400
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,760
against competitors.
对抗竞争对手。

401
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:28,520
So the key is to do computation at a higher priority than the competitor.
所以关键是将计算优先级设置得比竞争对手高。

402
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:35,240
And again, the way you do it, the way you are doing it, some of these game developers
再说一次，你的做法，你正在做的方式，其中一些游戏开发者

403
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,580
just put a bunch of print Fs because the print Fs again, you have IO.
只需连续使用一系列的print F，因为再次使用print F，你就有了输入输出。

404
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:44,880
So the thread is put to sleep and then when you come back, it's going to go to the high
所以线程被暂停，当你回来时，它将进入高优先级。

405
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,880
priority queue.
优先队列。

406
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,360
While if you don't have to go to sleep, you are going to fall through the levels to the
当然，如果你不必要去睡觉，你会一直陷入各个层次，直到最后一层。

407
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,200
bottom level and you are going to be treated with a lower priority.
底层，你将会被给予较低的优先级对待。

408
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,200
So it's fun.
那真是太有趣了。

409
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,400
Multi-core scheduling.
多核调度。

410
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
You have multiple core.
你有多个核心。

411
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,120
Now all the processors have multiple cores, your Mac has multiple cores, your PC has multiple
现在所有的处理器都有多个核心，你的Mac有多个核心，你的PC也有多个核心。

412
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,360
cores, your phones have multiple cores.
核心，你的手机有多个核心。

413
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:16,440
Algorithmically is not a huge difference now, but implementation wise, there are some things
算法上现在没有太大的区别，但在实现上，有一些事情。

414
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,800
you need to keep in mind.
你需要记住。

415
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,440
And one thing to keep in mind is a cache coherence.
还有一件事要记住，那就是缓存一致性。

416
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:30,240
Every core has its own cache and therefore you want to have this affinity scheduling.
每个核心都有自己的缓存，因此你希望进行亲和调度。

417
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:39,440
You want to schedule a thread on the same CPU when it turns calm.
你想在CPU变得空闲时安排一个线程。

418
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
Why?
为什么？

419
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,520
Because if you do so, that thread, you can leverage the data of that thread, which is
因为如果你这样做，那个线程，你可以利用那个线程的数据，这是一个很好的机会。

420
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,200
still in the local cache of the same CPU.
仍然在同一CPU的本地缓存中。

421
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,920
If you schedule the thread on a different CPU, then that cache will not have any data
如果你将线程调度到不同的CPU上，那么该缓存将不会有任何数据。

422
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,080
of that thread.
那个帖子的内容。

423
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,400
So spinlock and multiprocessor.
所以自旋锁和多处理器。

424
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,600
Let me just...
让我只是...

425
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:20,280
So it turns out that the one way actually to, especially for multiprocessors, is not...
所以事实证明，对于多处理器来说，唯一的方法实际上并不是...

426
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,640
There are two reasons why you use spinlocks.
使用自旋锁有两个原因。

The first reason is that spinlocks provide a simple and efficient way to synchronize access to shared resources in a multi-threaded environment. When a thread encounters a spinlock, it will repeatedly check if the lock is available, rather than immediately blocking and waiting for the lock to be released. This can be beneficial in situations where the lock is expected to be held for a short period of time, as it avoids the overhead of context switching between threads.

The second reason is that spinlocks can be used in real-time systems or in situations where blocking is not allowed. In these cases, it is important to avoid the unpredictability and potential delays that can occur when a thread is blocked and has to wait for a lock to be released. Spinlocks allow threads to continuously check for the availability of a lock, ensuring that they can make progress without being blocked.

427
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,120
And the spinlock is just waiting for some condition to become true and you can do the
而自旋锁只是在等待某个条件变为真时，你可以执行

428
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,720
test and set on a particular value.
测试并设置特定值。

429
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,280
It's like, think about acquiring the lock.
就像，想象一下获取锁。

430
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,720
And there are two cases to use a spinlock.
并且使用自旋锁有两种情况。

431
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:44,360
One is typically when you have multiple threads to execute at the same time.
一个典型的情况是当你需要同时执行多个线程时。

432
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,600
Like for instance, you have two threads which communicate between each other, so you have
例如，你有两个线程彼此之间进行通信，所以你有

433
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,640
to run them at the same time.
同时运行它们。

434
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:56,200
So you want then the threads to wait for each other to be scheduled at the same time.
所以你希望线程等待彼此在同一时间被调度。

435
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:02,680
So if one thread is scheduled first, the second thread, it has to wait for the second thread
所以如果一个线程被先调度，第二个线程就必须等待第一个线程。

436
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,040
to be scheduled in order for instance to start the communication.
为了安排顺序，以便开始沟通。

437
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,400
And you use typically for that test and set.
你通常使用那个测试和设置。

438
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,680
Now, the problem is this test and set.
现在，问题是这个测试和设置。

439
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:19,120
If this test and set is done on, you know, you have different threads on different cores,
如果对这个测试和设置进行操作，你知道，在不同的核心上有不同的线程，

440
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:25,920
the test and set you are going to enforce a write, right?
你要执行的是测试并设置操作，对吗？

441
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,680
If you remember the test and set takes a value from the others.
如果你记得测试和设置从其他地方获取一个值。

442
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,720
and then set that value to one,
然后将该值设置为1。

443
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,160
irrespective of what was the value before
不论之前的价值如何

444
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,760
and write it back in the memory
并将其写回内存中

445
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,080
and then return the original value.
然后返回原始值。

446
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,440
Okay, so this is what is test and set if you remember.
好的，如果你还记得的话，这是测试和设置的内容。

447
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,060
But if I'm going to write
但是如果我要写的话

448
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,360
and another test and set is going to read
另一个测试和设置即将读取。

449
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,600
from a different processor,
来自另一个处理器，

450
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,780
then you are going to,
那么你打算去哪里？

451
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,080
the value has to go through the memory
这个值必须经过内存。

452
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,060
and then go back between,
然后来回穿梭，

453
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:05,000
it's going to need to go to the other process
需要将其转到其他流程中。

454
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,220
which runs the thread again,
再次运行线程的是哪个部分？

455
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,760
it is in test and set.
它正在进行测试和设置。

456
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,240
So if two threads are going to test and set
那么如果有两个线程要进行测试和设置操作

457
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,760
and they run on different CPUs,
并且它们运行在不同的CPU上，

458
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,600
then you are going to ping pong the value
然后你要来回传递这个值

459
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,720
between each other without doing anything.
彼此之间什么都不做。

460
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,560
Okay?
好的。

461
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,600
Another way to do it,
另一种方法是，

462
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,120
if you need to do that,
如果你需要这样做的话，

463
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,400
is to do this test, test and set.
是要做这个测试，测试并设置。

464
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,080
And basically instead of doing,
而基本上不是做...

465
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,220
having in the wild test and set,
在野外进行测试和设置，

466
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,680
in the wild you have the value,
在野外，你有价值。

467
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,360
just look at the value
只看价值

468
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,240
and you look for the value for the acquiree,
你需要寻找被收购方的价值。

469
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,240
look for the value to become zero.
寻找使值变为零的方法。

470
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:46,800
And then, so this is going to just do a read.
然后，这只是一个读取操作。

471
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,680
So you read local value always.
所以你总是读取本地值。

472
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:57,200
And then you are going to do again a wild test and set
然后你打算再次进行一次疯狂的测试和设置。

473
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,840
if the value read is zero.
如果读取的值为零。

474
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,160
And the reason it was a second test and set
而且这是第二次测试和设置的原因

475
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,580
is because the race condition,
是因为竞态条件。

476
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,400
because you don't want,
因为你不想。

477
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,440
because you want to acquire the lock in this case,
因为在这种情况下你想要获取锁。

478
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,120
or which means to set the value to one
或者意味着将值设置为一。

479
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,620
and you don't know the race condition
而且你不知道竞态条件是什么

480
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:17,120
is that two threads executing test and set at the same time,
这是两个线程同时执行测试和设置吗？

481
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,120
they receive the value zero
他们收到了零的价值。

482
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,760
and then the both of them,
然后他们两个，

483
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,560
they are going to set to one.
他们打算开始。

484
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,720
In order to avoid that,
为了避免这种情况，

485
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,400
you do a test and set again to the value
你重新进行一次测试并将值设置回去。

486
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,160
and you have only one will succeed
你只有一个机会成功。

487
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,120
because test and set is going to be atomic.
因为测试和设置操作将是原子操作。

488
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,820
But again, the main point here is that you avoid a write
但是再次强调，这里的主要观点是你要避免写入。

489
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,560
and because you avoid a write,
因为你避免了一次写入操作，

490
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,480
you are going to go through the main memory
你将要经过主内存。

491
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,480
and you are going to go to avoid a lot of context switches.
你将要去避免很多上下文切换。

492
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,780
This, okay, that's great question.
这个，好的，那是个很好的问题。

493
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,760
Is this an issue of correctness or efficiency?
这是一个关于正确性还是效率的问题？

494
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,320
This is a question from Arshad.
这是Arshad的一个问题。

495
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,320
Yes, it's about, this is about the efficiency.
是的，这是关于效率的。

496
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,200
It's not about correctness.
这不是关于正确与否。

497
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,780
Both codes are correct.
这两个代码都是正确的。

498
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,440
Both using both test and set
同时使用测试和设置

499
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,480
and test and set are correct.
并且测试和设置是正确的。

500
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,880
It's only about efficiency.
这只是关于效率的问题。

501
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:20,280
Okay, good.
好的，很好。

502
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,540
And this is exactly why when these are used,
而这正是为什么当它们被使用时，

503
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:34,020
this spin locks and spin waiting,
这个自旋锁会自旋等待。

504
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,800
when multiple threads, again, like I just mentioned,
当多个线程再次出现时，就像我刚才提到的那样，

505
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,580
work together on a multiple core,
一起在多核上工作。

506
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,240
try to schedule them together.
尽量安排它们在一起。

507
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,480
This is also called gang scheduling.
这也被称为团队调度。

508
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,300
There are other ways to do it instead of using spin lock.
除了使用自旋锁之外，还有其他方法可以做到。

509
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,240
Another way is basically to tell the OS

518
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,640
By the way, there is another reason,

00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,260
which is wasted time to context switching to another slide.
这是浪费时间去切换到另一张幻灯片。

533
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,380
Instead, you just do a,

542
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,900
since the context switching.
自从上下文切换以来。

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,800
which is very simple, which is early deadline first, right?
是的，这是非常简单的，先处理早期的截止日期，对吗？

607
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,800
By the way, another, an example of our soft real time

624
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,680
how long each task is going to take.

630
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,000
It's impossible.

654
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,840
a leader line first.
首先是一条引线。

655
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:45,360
Typically they assume that the task I is periodic,
通常他们假设任务I是周期性的。

656
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:50,200
is periodic PI, meaning that, and computation CI,
是周期性的PI，意思是，以及计算CI。

657
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,880
meaning that in each period,
意思是在每个时期，

658
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,880
you have to perform a computation for that task.
你需要为那个任务进行计算。

659
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,640
Like for instance, every 100 milliseconds,
比如，每100毫秒，

660
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,640
the task needs to perform a computation of 10 milliseconds.
这个任务需要执行一个10毫秒的计算。

661
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,000
Example, think about,
例子，考虑一下。

662
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,120
it's again, something like a self-driving car
这又是类似于自动驾驶汽车的东西。

663
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,760
or anything in the car,
或者车里的任何东西，

664
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,520
you have sensors,
你有传感器。

665
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,920
which are like video cameras and so forth,
这些就像是视频相机之类的设备。

666
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,320
which periodically take, you know,
你知道的，定期进行的活动。

667
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,200
take a measurement,
测量一下。

668
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,080
maybe the state of the brake or the speed,
也许是刹车状态或速度的问题。

669
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,280
or obviously a video frame, right?
或者显然是一个视频帧，对吗？

670
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,960
And these are periodic and they need to be processed.
这些是周期性的，需要进行处理。

671
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,680
So before the next measurement is taken,
所以在进行下一次测量之前，

672
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,160
we need to process the previous measurement, right?
我们需要处理之前的测量结果，对吗？

673
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,640
That's kind of our motivation.
这是我们的动力所在。

674
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,160
And the early deadline first is very simple.
而且，最早的截止日期首先非常简单。

675
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,080
It's basically saying, like the name implies,
这基本上是在说，就像名字所暗示的那样，

676
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,960
you always schedule the task,
你总是安排任务，

677
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,200
whose deadline is the earliest.
哪个截止日期最早。

678
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,840
Okay.
Sure, I will do my best to assist you with your translations. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

679
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,160
That's it.
就这样。

680
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,760
Let's take an example.
让我们举个例子。

681
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,640
Okay.
Sure. Please go ahead and provide me with the text you would like me to translate.

682
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,000
So let's have three tasks.
那么我们来安排三个任务吧。

683
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,080
And for each task,
而对于每个任务，

684
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:18,080
the two numbers in parentheses represent the period,
括号中的两个数字代表时期。

685
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,440
the first number,
第一个数字，

686
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,280
and how long it needs to come,
并且需要多长时间才能到达？

687
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,440
it should take to compute in this period.
这个时间段应该需要计算。

688
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,480
So 4-1 means that every four time you need,
所以4-1的意思是每四次你需要一次。

689
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,680
say for every four seconds,
每四秒钟说一次，

690
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:35,320
T1 requires one second of computation.
T1需要一秒钟的计算时间。

691
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:40,320
T2 during five seconds requires two seconds of computation.
T2在五秒钟内需要两秒的计算时间。

692
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,480
T3 every seven seconds requires two seconds of computation.
T3每七秒需要两秒的计算时间。

693
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,560
Right?
对吗？

694
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,640
And these are the first two deadlines, right?
是的，这是前两个截止日期，对吗？

695
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,080
Because you need to finish to process
因为你需要完成处理。

696
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,720
in the current period before the next period starts.
在下一个周期开始之前的当前时期。

697
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,640
So for T1, the first deadline is time five,
所以对于T1，第一个截止时间是时间五。

698
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,160
for T2, time four, sorry,
对于T2，时间是四，抱歉。

699
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,400
for T2 is five, for T3 is seven, right?
T2是五，T3是七，对吗？

700
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,440
So therefore, first,

701
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:13,920
you are going to schedule,
你要安排时间表。

702
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,880
and say the time quanta here is one.

703
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,840
So first you are going to schedule T1, right?
首先你要安排T1，对吗？

704
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,680
Why?
为什么？

705
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,760
Because the deadline is the earliest, right?
因为截止日期是最早的，对吗？

706
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,760
You see, it's at four.
你看，时间是四点。

707
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,360
The other deadlines are at five and seven.

you are going to schedule T2.
你要安排T2。

710
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,040
And let's assume that we don't preempt here,

711
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:36,880
for simplicity.
为了简单起见。

712
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:43,960
And because T2 has earlier deadlines than T3,
而且由于T2的截止日期比T3早，

713
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,120
five versus seven.
五对七。

714
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:49,640
So schedule that, and finally, you schedule T3.
好的，我会安排这个，最后，你要安排T3。

715
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,280
Now, what are the next deadlines?
